### // Instructions
In preparation for our final project in this course, I would like you to make a draft business model. Select an idea relevant to your creative practice—this could be starting your own studio, launching a product, running a music festival—it's really up to you. 

This idea will be the focus of the final project: a business plan. As a first step, I'd like you to brainstorm a business model for your idea. 

For each section below, **throw in a few sentences or bullet points or sketches... just a starting point for each**. We're going to discuss this as a group during our business plan work session. 

1. **Profile**   
	*What is your idea? Who is carrying it out? What is your business structure?*


2. **Customer Segments**  
	*Who is being served by your idea? Are they all the same or can you break them into different types?*

3. **Value Proposition**   
	*Why do your customer's care? What of value are you offering them?*

4. **Channels**   
	*How do you get your idea to your customers?*

5. **Customer Relationships**   
	*What kind of relationship are you maintaining with your customer segments?*

6. **Revenue Streams**
	*You got value and customers, now where's the money coming from?*

7. **Key Resources**   
*What do you need in order to even produce the idea and reach those customers?*

8. **Key Activities**   
	*What are the literal activities you have to undertake to make your idea a reality?*
	
9. **Key Partnerships**   
*Your idea isn't going to come to life in a vacuum. Who are you working with? What partnerships are necessary to make your idea a success?*

10. **Cost Structure**   
	*What will it cost to make your idea a reality? This is beyond money—you also have to think about time, people, and effort.*
