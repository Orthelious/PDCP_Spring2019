# PROJECT #1: GRANT PROPOSAL
### Due 3/17/19 @ 11:59 PM

Please submit quiz via Google Form.

## INSTRUCTIONS
The first project for this course will be to complete a grant application that will be worth 10 points of your final grade. The grant is from my foundation, the Hughes Foundation, an imaginary foundation that supports early-career creative practitioners. This grant is modeled after two different, real-world grants I have applied to and received—one from a corporation and one from the National Endowment for the Arts.

This prompt is fairly wide open in terms of subject matter. You can apply for literally any project, as long as it fits within the terms of the RFP. I want projects to be feasible, but it's really up to you in what reality this takes place in—you could apply with your current practice, a practice you hope to have in the future or something completely new and different for you.

Apply for something you've always wanted to do, but make sure that it could actually be achieved.

### *A few important notes about this project:*
* No group work.
* Read the RFP closely. The ambiguity is on purpose and meant to replicate real RFP's I've encountered.
* You'll notice that you must list a "partner" for this grant. This is any partner you want—could be an artist, organization, company, etc—but a partnership is an essential element of the grant.
* I am the "Program Officer" for the grant. Much like the real world, questions about the grant may be directed to me.
Pay close attention to the character limits for each question.

## HOW TO APPLY
The Request for Proposals can be found here: [FINAL PROJECT RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpGipW936gSv8S9nJi18I7iPYEcWR_mkxJjR9JS2fl0/edit?usp=sharing)

Grants are due (via the application link) by Sunday, March 17th @ 11:59 PM.

## REVIEW PANEL
This project is linked with an in-class activity, the **Grant Review Panel**. During this panel, you will be reviewing and advising on final funding for your fellow students' grants. Each panel will be responsible for reviewing 5 grants.

The panel will meet on March 22nd @ 8:30 AM—our regular class meeting time. You will receive your packet approximately 3 days before the meeting. I will provide snacks, coffee and home-made goodies.

## GRADING RUBRIC 
I will assign the final grade for your project (not the review panel). I will evaluate proposals based on the following rubric:

### SCORING RUBRIC FOR COURSE PROJECTS

The grant writing project (GP) is worth ten points and the final project (FP) is worth 20 points. Course projects will be graded using the following rubric: 

* (A) Excellent — Student completed project with outstanding or exceptional narrative and perfect execution. The project was free of any spelling, grammatical and layout errors. The student demonstrated integration of course concepts into their project in a thoughtful and professional manner. 
GP: 10 Points / FP: 20 points


* (B) Good — Student successfully met all project requirements with good narrative and great execution, but with some (less than 5) spelling, grammatical or layout errors. Student demonstrated limited or minor integration of course concepts in project. 
*GP: 8 Points / FP: 16 points


* (C) Satisfactory — Student successfully met all project requirements with good narrative, but with multiple (more than 5) mistakes or errors in execution. 
GP: 6 Points / FP: 12 points


* (D) Passable — Student met project requirements, but with poor narrative and excessive (more than 10) mistakes or errors in execution. 
GP: 4 Points / FP: 8 points


* (E) Poor — Student did not meet all of project requirements, but at least submitted a final deliverable on time. 
GP: 2 Points / FP: 4 points


* (F) Failure Student did not submit a final deliverable. 
0 points awarded

## FINAL THOUGHTS
This project and the related in-class activity are serving a dual purpose: 

1. To force you to write about your creative practice in a business context, and 

2. To create an opportunity to analyze and critique how your fellow creative practitioners do the same.
