#### // Questions

###### — Question 1
The stars have aligned—you've secured your first major museum show. This is thanks in a large part to the gallerist who helped broker the relationship with the chief curator. You and the gallerist on your way to the museum to meet with the curator to brainstorm the scope and budget of the exhibition. Because of the size and complexity of the installation, the museum has brought an outside exhibit designer to the meeting. Hopefully the meeting goes well and you agree on a budget, because the museum staff must go to Company X to secure sponsorship to pay for the show.

It looks like the perfect opportunity for your creative practice, but the building manager informs you that studio residents must partcipate in group shows with an assigned curator. This is going to be built into the lease agreement. This makes you a little unnerved—but the space, location, and price are unbeatable—so you prepare to negotiate.
