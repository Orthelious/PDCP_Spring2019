# FINAL PROJECT: BUSINESS PLAN
### Due 5/10/19 @ 5:00 PM

## Instructions
The final assignment in this course is to develop a personalized business plan for your creative practice. I want you to choose an idea—this could be as simple as a singular exhibition to as complex as a major corporations—and through a business plan *tell me how you're going to pull it off.*

*There are going to be two deliverables for this project:*

1. A written business plan that does not exceed five pages (not including appendices).
2. A 5-minute presentation with no more than 10 slides. 

Here are the elements I'm going to require°. You do not need to literally answer the questions in each section—those are just prompts to get you started. Yes, this project is purposely vague. 

### 1. Executive Summary
* Who are you?
* What are you doing?
* Why should we care?

### 2. Business Model
* What's your value proposition?
* Who are your customer segments and what is your relationship to them? What channels will you use to reach them?
* What/How are you doing this? What resources do you need and who are your key partners?
* How much will it cost?
* How much will you make?

### 3. Financial Analysis
* What is your operational budget?
* What is the cost structure for your project?
* What kind of revenues can you project?

### 4. Environmental Scan
What are the external factors that affect our model? (We'll cover this more in the marketing unit)

* Market Forces  
* Industry Forces
* Key trends 
* Macroeconomic Forces 

### 5. Timeline

* When is this happening? 

### 6. Risk Analysis 
* What are your biggest obstacles?
* What is critical for your success?
