# Assignments

This course has three types of assignments:

* **Homework assignments** — Homework assignments will usually require group-work, online research and some level of analysis. Homework assignments are worth 5 points each and finished assignments will be discussed in class.

* **Take-home quizzes** — Quizzes will be comprised of a series of short-response prompts based on real-life situations. These are intended to help you practice applying class concepts to your own practices. You may use any resource at your disposal to complete quizzes. Quizzes are worth 5 points each.

* **Course Projects** — There will be two projects for this course: (1) A 2-3 page grant proposal worth 10 points and (2) a final business plan worth 20 points.

## Submission
1. Please submit assignments via canvas
2. Unless otherwise noted in the prompt, all assignments should be submitted as an editable documents. (i.e. a Google Doc link, a Microsoft Word file, etc). This is so I can provide feedback.
