## <a name="AS">// Assignment STRUCTURE</a>  
Assements will be posted in the assignments folder

_This course has four types of assignments:_  
 
* **Homework assignments** — Homework assignments will usually require group-work, online research and some level of analysis. Homework assignments are worth 5 points each and finished assignments will be discussed in class.

* **Take-home quizzes** — Quizzes will be comprised of a series of short-response prompts based on real-life situations. These are intended to help you practice applying class concepts to your own practices. You may use any resource at your disposal to complete quizzes. Quizzes are worth 5 points each.
 
* **Course Projects** — There will be two projects for this course: (1) A 2-3 page grant proposal worth 10 points and (2) a final business plan worth 20 points.    
 
* **Class engagement** — Individual student engagement will be determined by the instructor. 

	Engagement is worth 20 points (20% of your final grade) — 10 points will be entered at mid-term and 10 after the final. **All students will begin the course with a bank of the full 20 points and may only lose points for infractions.** Each infraction will result first in a verbal warning, and if the behavior continues, the student will lose 1 point (equivalent to 1% of your final grade). Students will be made aware of point reductions privately via email.  

	_For the purpose of this course, infractions will be defined as:_    
	1.	Lack of attentiveness (i.e. asleep with head on desk or working on other course classwork during this course)  
	2. Not having devices in politeness mode (i.e. having a laptop/smartphone open/out during class)  
	3. Lack of engagement in class discussion (i.e. the student has not expressed a single opinion or asked a question at least once over the entirety of the course).
