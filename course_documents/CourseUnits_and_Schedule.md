## // UNITS

_This course is organized into the following eight units and sub-topics. Sub-topics represent approximately 1 hour of class time._ 
#### <a name="0">UNIT 0 — Course Introduction</a>
***Summary*** — During this first unit of the course, we will review the syllabus, expectations and resources for the course. This unit also includes some framing devices for this course such as Creative Practitioner Profiles and Degrees of Difficulty. 

[[0.1]	Course Introduction and key concepts](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/tree/master/units/0_CourseIntroduction)
***

#### <a name="a">UNIT A	Business Structures, Agency, and Labor</a>
***Summary*** — This unit starts with the basic legal structures used to organize and conduct business in the United States (and in most cases, internationally). We will cover some of the most commonly used business structures including Sole Proprietorships, Partnerships, LLC, S and C Corporations, B Corporations and Not-for-Profit Organizations. Discussion will include defining these structures and how they are formed, examples in creative practice, and discussing the pros and cons of each. 

With that starting knowledge, we will dive head-first into Agency and Labor. Or simply put, "How to work with other people." We will go over the legal concept of agency and break down the systems that exist to employ others — and the ethics, laws and best practices that come with each method.

***
#### <a name="b">UNIT B — Intellectual Property</a>
***Summary*** — As creative practitioners, we all participate in the act of intellectual property creation. Whether that’s for our own personal work, as part of our professional practice, or in service to an employer or client. But what is intellectual property? In this unit we will define the legal definitions of IP, the rights that you have, and IP protections such as patent, copyright, trademark, etc. From there, we will discuss how to share and monetize IP as a method for generating value. We will also explore the ways in which we can change, alter, rip, pirate, destroy, remix and recreate the work of others as a part of our creative process.

* [[B.3] Licensing and Royalties  
](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/units/B_IntellectualProperty/b3_licensing_and_royalties.md)
* [[B.4]	Permissions, Derivatives, and Fair Use](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/units/B_IntellectualProperty/b4_permissions_derivitatives_fairuse.md)
 
***

#### <a name="c">UNIT C — Agreements and Contract Law</a>
***Summary*** — One of the major lessons I hope you take away from this course is: never start work without an agreement in place! It is essential to understand how a legal agreement can restrain you, bind you, empower you, and—most importantly of all—protect you. During this unit we will discuss what constitutes a legal agreement, the essential elements of any contract, and how to identify warning signs in tricky, often imperceptible legal language.

[C.1]	Standards for Legal Agreements  
[C.2]	Contracting Basics  

*** 
#### <a name="d">UNIT D — Finance</a>
***Summary*** — One of the trickiest and often hardest questions to answer in creative practices: *How will we pay for it?* Over the course of this unit we will cover the high-level basics to financing your ideas, methods for generating income and best practices for managing your finances. Topic will include the common methods of fundraising; how to set market-competitive prices for your work and services; best practices for proposal writing; long-term planning for your financial future; and delving into the intimidating world of taxes (it's really not that bad!). 

[D.1]	Introduction to Financial Concepts  
[D.2]	Fundraising: Gifts and Debt Financing  
[D.3]	Fundraising: Grants  
[D.4]	Earned Income: Sales and Price   
[D.5]	Earned Income: Services, Rates and Fees  
[D.6]	Proposal Writing and Budgeting Basics  
[D.7]	Managing Finances and Financial Planning  
[D.8]	Taxes  
***
#### <a name="e"> UNIT E — Business Planning</a>
***Summary*** — The goal of this Unit is to present a surface level entry point into the world of strategic planning, business models, and market analysis. These high-level tools are focused on the forest, not the trees. We will use a series of frameworks to practice taking a nebulous idea and turning it into a realistic, actionable plan. We will focus in particular on Business Plans—for the final project of this course, all students will make and present an individual business plan.   

[E.1]	Business Plans and Models  
[E.2]	Elements of Business Strategy and Market Analysis  
[E.3]	Long-term Planning  
#### <a name="f">UNIT F — Communications</a>
***Summary*** — How do we get our work in front of people? The *right* people? This question is the root goal of good marketing and communications strategies. During this unit, we will go over the basics of how to put a communications strategy together, understand the best practices of public relations, and effectively market your work. 

[F.1]	Marketing Basics  
[F.2]	Public Relations and Media
#### <a name="g">UNIT G — Interaction Skills</a>
***Summary*** — Success in business is often a combination of the right knowledge and the right tools paired with great people skills. Creative practices cannot thrive in a vacuum. We have to interact with others in order to gain knowledge, connections, leverage and access. During this unit we will focus on three types of interaction skills—presentation, networking and negotiation—necessary for creative practices and business in general. 

[G.1]	Presentation Skills  
[G.2]	Networking  
[G.3]	Negotiation
