##UNITS

_This course is organized into the following eight units. Units represent approximately 1 hour of class time._ 
#### <a name="0">UNIT 0 — Course Introduction</a>
***Summary*** — During this first unit of the course, we will review the syllabus, expectatations and resources for the course. This unit also includes some framing devices for the course like Creative Practioner Profiles and Degrees of Difficulty. 

[0.1]	Course Introduction and key concepts
***

#### <a name="a">UNIT A	Business Structures, Agency, and Labor</a>
***Summary*** — This unit start with the basic legal structures used to organize and conduct business in the United States (and in most cases, internationally). We will cover some of the most commonly used business structures including Sole Proprietorships, Partnerships, LLC, S and C Corporations, B Corporations and Not-for-Profit Organizations. Discussion will include defining these structures and how they are formed, examples in creative practice, and discussing the pros and cons of each. 

With that starting knowledge, we will dive head-first into Agency and Labor. Or simply put, "How to work with other people." We will go over the legal concept of agency and break down the systems that exist to employ others — and the ethics, laws and best practices that come with each method. 
 
[A.1]	Business Structures and Models  
[A.2]	Agency and the types of Employment  
[A.3]	Human Resources and Labor Law   
[A.4]	Independent Contractors  
***
#### <a name="b">UNIT B — Intellectual Property</a>
***Summary*** — As creative practitioners, we all participate in the act of intellectual property creation. Whether that’s for our own personal work, as part of our professional practice, or in service to an employer or client. But what is intellectual property? In this unit we will define the legal definitions of IP, the rights that you have, and IP protections such as patent, copyright, trademark, etc. From there, we will discuss how to share and monetize IP as a method for generating value. We will also explore the ways in which we can change, alter, rip, pirate, destroy, remix and recreate the work of others as a part of our creative process.

[B.1]	Introduction to Intellectual Property  
[B.2]	IP Protections and Artists Rights  
[B.3]	Licensing and Royalties  
[B.4]	Permissions, Derivitives, and Fair Use  
***
#### <a name="c">UNIT C — Agreements and Contract Law</a>
***Summary*** — One of the major lessons I hope you take away from this course is: never start work without an agreement in place! It is essential to understand how a legal agreement can restrain you, bind you, empower you, and—most importantly of all—protect you. During this unit we will discuss what constitutes a legal agreement, the essential elements of any contract, and how to identify warning signs in tricky, often imperceptible legal language.

[C.1]	Standards for Legal Agreements  
[C.2]	Contracting Basics  
[C.3]	Contract Analysis and Enforceability 
*** 
#### <a name="d">UNIT D — Finance</a>
***Summary*** — One of the trickiest and often hardest questions to answer in creative practices: *How will we pay for it?* Over this massive unit we will cover the high-level basics to financing your ideas, methods for generating income and best practices for managing your finances. Topic will include the common methods of fundrasising; how to set market-competive prices for your work and services; best practices for proposal writing; long-term planning for your financial future; and devling into the intidating world of taxes (it's really not that bad!). 

[D.1]	Introduction to Financial Concepts  
[D.2]	Fundrasising: Gifts and Debt Financing  
[D.3]	Fundraising: Grants  
[D.4]	Earned Income: Sales and Price
