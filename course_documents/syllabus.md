## <a name="cd"> Course Description</a>
This course is intended to expose students studying in creative fields to the basic principles, skills and functions of business used every day in creative practices and industries. Supporting a creative practice - whether an individual studio practice, a temporary collaboration or commission, or an incorporated business or non-profit - all require a foundational knowledge of basic organizational, legal, and financial structures and practices. 

Throughout this seminar-style course, students can expect to develop a starting knowledge of basic business concepts; learn a foundational understanding of ethics and best practices in business; develop problem-solving skill sets and methodologies for managing creative projects and programs; and practice applying these learnings to their own creative practices. Topics covered will include, but are not limited to: basic business structures; intellectual property; contracts and employment; methods for generating income and fundraising; financial management and taxes; marketing and communications; negotiation and compromise; and elements of business strategy development. 


## <a name="cf">Course Framing</a>

### // LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Build a foundational knowledge and vocabulary of business concepts, laws and practices.  
1. Introduce the ethics, best practices, and common pitfalls for each of these topics.  
1. Practice applying these concepts to an individual's creative practice.  
1. Engage in planning for post-degree success through writing assignments, participatory workshops, and developing a business plan.  

### // PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE 
* This course assumes no prior knowledge, business coursework or administrative experience.

### // CLASS ETIQUETTE  
1. **Be on time** — Class starts at 8:30am.
   
1. **Be present**  — Engage with course content and engage with your classmates.
   
1. **Keep electronics in 'politeness mode'** — i.e. closed or face down and on silent. If you must use your electronics for an emergency, please go out in the hall.  

1. **Politeness is required** — No one gets to be rude or ramble. There will be no interrupting of or speaking over classmates. Threatening or aggressive language will not be tolerated. Students engaging in such behavior will be verbally warned, and if the behavior continues, asked to leave the classroom.   

1. **Respect for identity** — For this course to have the intended impact, it is necessary that we all be ourselves (to the best of our ability). How someone identifies themselves in this course (gender, sexuality, social and economic status, profession, etc) is how they will be identified by their classmates and their instructor. 

*Students are encouraged to hold Instructor to these same standards of etiquette.*

### // A FEW GUIDING PHILOSOPHIES FOR THIS COURSE
#### — *All Career Paths are Valid*
There are going to be endless opinions that you will hear/have heard throughout your life on what makes a great artist, an amazing designer, or a brilliant architect. If you choose to adhere to these standards, that is your choice. We will not debate or discuss the best career path in this course. Likewise, we will consider career sucess to be however an individual student defines it for themselves. 

If you want to work in a corporation, go for it. If you want to run an anti-capitalist social movement, do it. If you want to be an art world gallery star, rad. If you want to be a hermit in the woods, awesome. Any of the units we cover in this course can apply to whatever career direction you want to take, but we will not debate which is the best. 

#### — *Think of Business like Cooking*
I've spent a lot of time over the past year teaching myself to cook. One of my favorite books on the subject is [Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat/Samin-Nosrat/9781476753836) by Samin Nosrat. The basic premise is that mastering four basic factors will make food taste delicious. But these are just *elements* of good cooking. There is a world of amazing food that depends heavily on our culture, background, personal taste and preference—and our appetites.   

Business is very much the same way. We're going to discuss how business works and go through many of the best practices—but how you best apply these factors to your practice depends on your background, your tastes, your needs.  

#### — *The Correct Answers ≠ the Right Answers* 
The units we will cover throughout the semester are frameworks, guidelines, skills, and concepts for achieving success in creative practices. These are not *rules*. So, while an answer may be *correct* and match best practices, that does not make it automatically the *right* answer for your practice. 

#### — *Be Yourself*   
Please consider this class a safe space, once a week, for three hours, to explore what you want to do with your life and creative practice. Ask the questions that are difficult, that feel dumb, or that feel intimidating to ask out loud. My goal in this class is not to turn you into the perfect businessperson, but to empower you.

### // ATTENDANCE POLICY
Please look at the [Semester Schedule](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/course_documents/CourseUnits_and_Schedule.md)  and see if you need to miss class for any excusable reason (religious observance, job interview, university-sanctioned event, etc.) and notify me as soon as possible. We may be able to make alternative arrangements for completing assignments. If there are extenuating circumstances that require you to miss more than one class session, please come and discuss this issue with me in advance of your absence(s).   

* If you are tardy (8:45am or later) three times, you will be marked down for **one absence**  
* Three or more unexcused absences will result in the drop of **one letter grade**.  



### // RECORDING POLICY
No student may record any classroom activity without express written consent from me.  If you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape classroom activities, you should contact the Office of Disability Resources to request an appropriate accommodation.

### // SAFER SPACES POLICY 
I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment in the classroom for everyone, regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, religion, or marital status. Harassment includes offensive comments related to any protected personal characteristic, deliberate intimidation, sustained disruption of speech, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  

Students asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If student continues to engage in harassing behavior, they will be ejected from the classroom. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact me and/or Mark Cato in the School of Art Office.   
### // SUPPORT RESOURCES 
**Take care of yourself.**  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at [http://www.cmu.edu/counseling](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling). Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
