##<a name="CD"> Course Description</a>
This course is intended to expose students studying in creative fields to the basic principles, skills and functions of business used every day in creative practices and industries. Supporting a creative practice - whether an individual studio practice, a temporary collaboration or commission, or an incorporated business or non-profit - all require a foundational knowledge of basic organizational, legal, and financial structures and practices. 

Throughout this seminar-style course, students can expect to develop a starting knowledge of basic business concepts; learn a foundational understanding of ethics and best practices in business; develop problem-solving skill sets and methodologies for managing creative projects and programs; and practice applying these learnings to their own creative practices. Topics covered will include, but are not limited to: basic business structures; intellectual property; Contracts and employment; methods for generating income and fundraising; financial management and taxes; marketing and communications; negotiation and compromise; and elements of business strategy development. 

#### _Prerequisite Knowledge_  
This course assumes no prior knowledge of business coursework or administrative experience.

#### _Course Goals_  
1) Build a foundational knowledge and vocabulary of business concepts, laws and practices.  
2) Introduce the ethics, best practices, and common pitfalls for these topics.  
3) Apply these concepts to an individual's particular creative practice.  
4) Engage in planning for post-degree success through writing assignments, participatory workshops, and developing a business plan.  

#### _Assessment Structure_  
This course has four types of assessments.   
1) Short-response homework assignments.   
2) Take-home quizzes on course units.   
3) Class engagement.  
4) A written midterm and a final project—both of which have in-class presentation requirements.  

##<a name="CF">Course Framing</a>

######_Some notes on class etiquette:_  
1) **Be on time** — Class starts at 8:30am.   
2) **Be present**  — Engage with course content and engage with your classmates.   
3) **Keep electronics in 'politeness mode'** — i.e. closed or face down and on silent. If you must use your electronics for an emergency, please go out in the hall.  
4) **Politeness is required** — No one gets to be rude or ramble. There will be no interrupting or speaking over classmates. Threatening or aggressive language will not be tolerated.  
5) **Respect identity** — For this course to have impact, it is necessary that we all be ourselves to the best of our ability. How someone identifies themselves in this course (gender, sexuality, socially, economically, professionally, etc) is how they will be identified by their classmates and their instructor. 

######_A few guiding philosophies for this course:_   
####**All Career Paths are Valid**   
There are going to be opinions you'll hear throughout your degrees and in your careers on what makes a great artist, an amazing designer, a brilliant architect—but I honestly don't care. If you want to work in a corporation, go for it. If you want to run an anti-capitalist social movement, do it. If you want to be an gallery star, rad. If you want to be a hermit in the woods, awesome. Any of the concepts we cover in this course can apply to whatever career direction you want to take, but we will not debate what the best path is. 

####**Think of Business like Cooking**  
I've spent a lot of my time over the past year learning to cook. One of my favorite books on the subject is [_Salt Fat Acid Heat_] (https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat/Samin-Nosrat/9781476753836) by Samin Nosrat. The basic premise is that mastering four basic factors will make food taste delicious. But from that point, there is a world of food that depends so heavily on culture, background, personal taste and preference, and our appetites.   

Business is very much the same way. We're going to talk about how things work, but how you best apply factors to your practice depends on you. 

####**The Correct Answers ≠ the Right Answers**  
What we will cover over the course of the semester are frameworks, guidelines, skills, and concepts for achieving success. These are not *rules*. Just because an answer is *correct*, that does not make it automatically the *right* answer for your practice. 

####**Be yourself**   
Consider this class a safe space, once a week, for three hours, to explore what you want to do with your life and practice. Ask the questions that are difficult, or that feel dumb, or that feel scary. My goal in this class is not to turn you into the perfect businessperson, but to empower you.
