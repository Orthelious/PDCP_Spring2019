##<a name="CD"> Course Description</a>
This course is intended to expose students studying in creative fields to the basic principles, skills and functions of business used every day in creative practices and industries. Supporting a creative practice - whether an individual studio practice, a temporary collaboration or commission, or an incorporated business or non-profit - all require a foundational knowledge of basic organizational, legal, and financial structures and practices. 

Throughout this seminar-style course, students can expect to develop a starting knowledge of basic business concepts; learn a foundational understanding of ethics and best practices in business; develop problem-solving skill sets and methodologies for managing creative projects and programs; and practice applying these learnings to their own creative practices. Topics covered will include, but are not limited to: basic business structures; intellectual property; Contracts and employment; methods for generating income and fundraising; financial management and taxes; marketing and communications; negotiation and compromise; and elements of business strategy development. 


##<a name="CF">Course Framing</a>

###_// Learning Objectives_
1) Build a foundational knowledge and vocabulary of business concepts, laws and practices.  
2) Introduce the ethics, best practices, and common pitfalls for these topics.  
3) Apply these concepts to an individual's particular creative practice.  
4) Engage in planning for post-degree success through writing assignments, participatory workshops, and developing a business plan.  

### _// Prerequisite Knowledge_  
This course assumes no prior knowledge of business coursework or administrative experience.

###_// Some notes on class etiquette:_  
1) **Be on time** — Class starts at 8:30am.   
2) **Be present**  — Engage with course content and engage with your classmates.   
3) **Keep electronics in 'politeness mode'** — i.e. closed or face down and on silent. If you must use your electronics for an emergency, please go out in the hall.  
4) **Politeness is required** — No one gets to be rude or ramble. There will be no interrupting or speaking over classmates. Threatening or aggressive language will not be tolerated.  
5) **Respect identity** — For this course to have impact, it is necessary that we all be ourselves to the best of our ability. How someone identifies themselves in this course (gender, sexuality, socially, economically, professionally, etc) is how they will be identified by their classmates and their instructor. 

###_// A few guiding philosophies for this course:_   
####**· All Career Paths are Valid**   
There are going to be opinions you'll hear throughout your degrees and in your careers on what makes a great artist, an amazing designer, a brilliant architect—but I honestly don't care. If you want to work in a corporation, go for it. If you want to run an anti-capitalist social movement, do it. If you want to be an gallery star, rad. If you want to be a hermit in the woods, awesome. Any of the concepts we cover in this course can apply to whatever career direction you want to take, but we will not debate what the best path is. 

####**· Think of Business like Cooking**  
I've spent a lot of my time over the past year learning to cook. One of my favorite books on the subject is [_Salt Fat Acid Heat_] (https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat/Samin-Nosrat/9781476753836) by Samin Nosrat. The basic premise is that mastering four basic factors will make food taste delicious. But from that point, there is a world of food that depends so heavily on culture, background, personal taste and preference, and our appetites.   

Business is very much the same way. We're going to talk about how things work, but how you best apply factors to your practice depends on you. 

####**· The Correct Answers ≠ the Right Answers**  
What we will cover over the course of the semester are frameworks, guidelines, skills, and concepts for achieving success. These are not *rules*. Just because an answer is *correct*, that does not make it automatically the *right* answer for your practice. 

####**· Be yourself**   
Consider this class a safe space, once a week, for three hours, to explore what you want to do with your life and practice. Ask the questions that are difficult, or that feel dumb, or that feel scary. My goal in this class is not to turn you into the perfect businessperson, but to empower you.

###// GRADING SCALE FOR ASSIGNMENTS
&&

###// OTHER GRADING POLICIES
***ENGAGEMENT** — Individual student engagement will be determined by the instructor. All students will begin the course with 20 points (20% of your final grade) and may only lose points for infractions. Each infraction will result first in a verbal warning, and if the behavior continues, the student will lose 
1 point (equivalent to 1% of your final grade). Students will be made aware of point reductions privately via email. 

_For the purpose of this course, infractions will be defined as:_  
· Lack of attentiveness (i.e. asleep or working on other course classwork during this course)  
· Not having devices in politeness mode (i.e. having a laptop/smartphone open/out during class)  
· Lack of engagement in class discussion (i.e. the student has not expressed an opinion or asked a question at least once over the entirety of the course).

**GROUP WORK** — Group work is encouraged for homework assignments with the exception of the final project and/or specific assignments as noted by the instructor. If students choose to work as a group, they must include collaborators’ names on their assignment. Groups are limited to 3 students.

**LATE WORK** — Homework assignments are due at the start of class. Check the course schedule for assignment due dates. Late assignments may be submitted up to two days after due date and will receive an automatic (I) grade. Submission of a late final project will result in reduction of one letter grade.

##<a name="OCP">Other Class Policies</a>
###// ATTENDANCE POLICY
Please look ahead and see if you need to miss class for any excusable reason (religious observance, job interview, university-sanctioned event, etc.) and notify me as soon as possible. We may be able to make alternative arrangements for completing assignments. If there are extenuating circumstances that require you to miss more than one class session, please come and discuss this issue with me in advance of your absence(s).   

· If you are tardy (8:40am or later) three times, this will count as **one absense**  
· Three or more unexcused absences will result in the drop of **one letter grade**.  



###// RECORDING POLICY
No student may record any classroom activity without express written consent from me.  If you have (or think you may have) a disability such that you need to record or tape classroom activities, you should contact the Office of Disability Resources to request an appropriate accommodation.
###// SAFER SPACES POLICY 
I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment in the classroom for everyone, regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, religion, or marital status. Harassment includes offensive comments related to any protected personal characteristic, deliberate intimidation, sustained disruption of speech, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  

Students asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact me  and/or Mark Cato in the School of Art Office.   
###// SUPPORT RESOURCES 
**Take care of yourself.**  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

**If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:**
