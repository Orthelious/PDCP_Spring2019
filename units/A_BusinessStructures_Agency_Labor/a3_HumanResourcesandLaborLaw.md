## <a name="empemp">The Employer/Employee Relationship</a>

### // Some Context
Why does understanding human resources and labor law matter? Let's look as some local examples*:

* [The Mattress Factory](https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2019/01/03/NLRB-closes-Mattress-Factory-investigation-Pittsburgh/stories/201901040026)
* [The Kelly-Strayhorn Theater](https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2014/06/28/Former-Kelly-Strayhorn-employee-sues-claims-firing-was-retaliation/stories/201406280034)
* [Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts](https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2015/12/09/Charlie-Humphrey-resigns-as-executive-director-of-Pittsburgh-Filmmakers-Pittsburgh-Center-for-the-Arts/stories/201512090197)

***DISCLAIMER**: *I was an intern at the Mattress Factory and have worked in different capacities with PF/PCA and KST. By presenting these cases, I am not taking an explicit stance nor am I representing the opinion of this university. I've used these examples as they are well publicized and relevant to our topic.*


### // Defining Employees
**EMPLOYEE** — A person (agent) hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a principal (employer), whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal. 

The Employer/Employee relationship is one of the most common types of agency relationships. The employer (the principal) controls **all** the aspects of the employees job. 

This can include: 

* When the employee is paid and at what rate
* What conditions (i.e. office or shop) they will work in 
* What tasks the employee must perform
* What equipment the employee must use to complete their job

And many more...

***What are some employer/employee experiences from your own life and creative practce?***

### // Setting the Ground Rules
While an employer has a great deal of control over the employee's job, they do not have *unlimited authority*. All employers must adhere to two basic categories of US law when in comes to employment:

* **Labor Law** — The set of laws pertaining to the groups of people. These set of laws regulate unions and collective action. [[source]](http://www.gotnbc.com/Labor%20Law%20101.pdf)
* **Employment Law** — These laws regulate the rights of the individual worker. 

It is *essential* to understand the basics of these laws and practices if you hope to hire and manage employees. In large groups (more than 50) like corporations, adherence to these laws and regulations is usually handled by a Human Resources manager or department. 

*PLEASE NOTE: I am only covering **federal laws.** Each state has their own additional set of laws governing labor practices and regulations.*

## <a name="labor">Labor Law and the Rights of the Group</a>
In general, Labor Law references the area of law that governs how a group of employees must be treated and their right to action. Think of a factory, a farm, a museum, the production of a film—all require the efforts of a *group* of employees to succeed.

This is especially important in creative practices regarding the formation of, and and how to work with, labor unions. 

*Some helpful definitions:*

* **Labor Union** — an organization of workers formed for the purpose of advancing its members' interests in respect to wages, benefits, and working conditions. [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/labor%20union)
* **Collective Bargaining** — negotiation between an employer and a labor union usually on wages, hours, and working conditions. [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collective%20bargaining)

### **// Labor Laws and Regulations to be Aware of:**
#### *— Fair Labor Standards Act*
*A federal law passed in 1938 that establishes a few key practices and regulations*

* The right to a minimum wage
* The right to overtime pay when exceeding a 40-hour work week
* Prohibits most employment of minors

*There are MANY additional acts that build on this law, further detailing the rights of the collective workforce. You can check out an abbreviated list here on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938)*

#### *— National Labor Relations Act*

Established in 1935, this act effectively enshrines the rights of workers to form labor unions (and other types of organizing activities) and collectively bargain to improve working conditions and wages. 


## <a name="emplaw">Employment Law and the Rights of the Individual</a>
A complement to Labor Law, we have employment law, which defines the rights of an individual worker *and job applicants.* 

Employment law, generally, deals with the following issues for the individual worker: 

* Discrimination
* Wrongful termination
* Wages and pay equity
* Taxation
* Harassment
* Right to privacy
* Workplace safety
* 'Whistleblower' rights
* Leave policies
* Hiring processes

## <a name="ethics">A Note On Employment Ethics</a>
*This portion of the lecture is essentially an op-ed by your instructor. As you create your own collaborations and businesses, I hope you will strongly consider the following ethical suggestions*

### — Be Open to Criticism to Invite Diverse Opinions
Diversity and inclusion should be a top priority for every company. It is my personal opinion that having the greatest variety of experience, cultural and professional background, and perspective builds the greatest framework for success. 

The way to get there is to create a healthy work environment for spirited, professional debate. The way to create a diverse and healthy workplace is to invite *constructive* criticism.  

### — Make the Rules Easy to Find
Employee handbooks are a great thing. Post important policies in the break room. Review your policies annually with your employees. Workplace rules are important, but not everyone will automatically know them and all too often the rules are misinterpreted through rumor and gossip. 

Do the work for your employees and make workplace policies easy to find. 

### — The Rules Should Apply to Everyone
My father, who has an MBA and worked in the corporate telecom world for 40 years, had an essential piece of advice when it came to managing employees: 

> "Just make sure you treat everyone the same." 

Making special cases, bending the rules for personal friends, not establishing clear policies — this is what creates the perfect petri dish for resentment to grow. If you have employees—build the work culture you want—but build it in such a way that policies protect your employees, empowers them, and create a level playing field. 

Avoid a system that awards special favors or exceptions. This is what can lead to a "boys club" atmosphere or contribute to systemic discrimination.  

### — Pay People Equitably. 
Pay people what they're worth. If you can't pay them what they're worth—be honest and upfront as to why *before the work begins*. And make sure that if they are doing the same work as another employee with the same skill level, **that they receive the same pay.**

### — Document! Document! Document!
Anytime you have an issue with an employer or anytime you need to discuss a human resources related issue with an employee—write it down. 

* Keep good records of when you've reprimanded someone. 
* Keep good records of hiring and promotion processes.
* Keep good records of what someone's job duties are.
* Keep good records of annual performance reviews and evaluations.
* Keep good records when you fire someone.

KEEP GOOD RECORDS, Y'ALL. 

### — Deal with Problems Immediately and Seek Professional Advice
Think of the last time you brought up an issue to your boss. I'm going to venture a guess that the longer it took for them to address it, the more it felt like they weren't taking you seriously. 

Deal with problems immediately. If you don't know what to do, seek professional advice from a human resources professional or an employment law attorney. 

### — Internships
Ah... internships. It is my opinion that internships (unless you're receiving course credit) should be paid positions. If you want to volunteer your time and your skills for no pay—my advice is to get as much of an educational experience as possible. But if you're just fetching coffee for the boss and sitting at a front desk twiddling your thumbs—that is a job and you should be paid.
