# [A.4]	Independent Contractors

This is a brief topic. The goal here is to draw a distinction between a traditional employee and an independent contractor. 

Not understanding this distinction can be one of the primary ways creative practitioners are taken advantage of. 

## EMPLOYEE VS. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

### // Let's first define the two:

**EMPLOYEE** — A person hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a entity, whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal.

*As we’ve discussed in A.2, the employer/employee relationship is a type of agency relationship.*

* The employee (agent) is controlled totally by the employer (principal)
* This relationship is additionally governed by labor and employment law.

**INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR**— A person hired to perform limited, specific duties for a party according to a contract, for a specific period of time. Their work conditions and methods are not strictly controlled by the principal, but by the terms of the contract.

An independent contractor is not (automatically) an agent in their relationship to the principal. 

* The key here is “independent”
* This relationship is governed by the contract between the two parties and standards of contract law.

### // How Do You Tell the Difference?
It's not just whether or not a principal *calls* you an employee or an independent contractor. The relationship has to be defined and follow a set of standards set out in US law. 

The IRS gives us at least these three top-level tests to determined whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor:


1. **Behavioral**: Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?
	* If the principal is supplying the office, the equipment, sets your hours, etc — you are most likely an employee. 
	* If you operate independently of the principal and determine for yourself how the job will get completed—you are likely a contractor. 
	
	
2.  **Financial**: Are the business aspects of the worker’s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)

	* How, when and in what manner you are paid for a job is a major determining factor. We're going to cover this in a greater level of detail in Unit E.

3. **Type of Relationship**: Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (i.e. pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? 
	* If you are receiving employee-type benefits, you are likely an employee. 
	* If you do not receive *employee-type benefits*, you are likely an contractor. 
	* Additionally, the contract between you and the principal should expressly state as much. We will cover more of this in Unit C. 

	Will the relationship continue
and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?
	
	* If yes, then you are likely an **employee**
	* If no and the relationship or key aspect of business has a *set end date* — you are a **contractor**.
