## <a name="ibsm">Introduction to Business Structures and Models</a>

You cannot conduct business in a vaccuum. You have to interact with others. But understanding exactly *who* you are conducting business with can be opaque without a basic understanding of business structures.

To start making sense of things, we need to answer two of the initial questions:

* What ***kind*** of business?
* What does the business ***do***?

### — Business Structures
Understanding how a business is structured helps us answer the first question of what kind of business we are dealing with. 

*What is a business structure?*

* The framework and/or legal establishment of an entity for conducting business.
* A business structure defines what the business is, but not necessarily what the
business does.
* A business structure answers questions like “Who owns the company?”, “How
can I raise money?” and “What taxes do I owe?”
* You will also hear the term business structure used interchangeably with
“Business Entities,” “Organizational Structures,” “Operating Models,”
“Business Licenses,“ and ”Business Types.”

### — Business Models
Business models help us answer the second questions: what does a particular business do? 

*What is a business model?*

* A design or strategy for how a business should operate. 
* A business model describes what resoruces are needed, how financing works, who the customers are, the likely sources of revenue, who the customers are, etc. 
* Here are some examples of business models in the for-profit sphere:

We're going to cover business models, and business plans, in *Unit E — Business Planning*. 


## <a name="cbs">Common Business Structures</a>  

Time to get down to business! (groan. I'll see myself out). 

*We're going to cover the following common business structures in this unit:*

1. Sole Proprietorships
2. Partnerships
3. Corporations
4. Non-Profit Corporations
5. Others: Cooperatives, B Corps, Benefit Corps, L3Cs

...*but first*

### // HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BUSINESS STRUCTURES
All business structures can be identified by at least the following six elements:

* **OWNERSHIP** — # of people/owners; Can that ownership be transferred?

* **FORMATION** — Requirements to officially register the business.
* **LIABILITY** — Whose assets are at risk?
* **TAXATION** — “How much $#@&! money do I owe the IRS?”
* **MANAGEMENT** — Who makes decisions?
* **FUNDRAISING ABILITY** — Determines the ways you can raise funds (Shares, stock, grants, gifts)

*We're going to use this chart so we don't lose out minds:*

* OWNERSHIP:
	* Singular owner.
	* No legal distinction between business and the owner. 
	* No ownership transfer.
* FORMATION: 
	* No requirements, but there are best practices like having a
business banking account and sometimes you need industry-specific licenses
or permits.
* LIABILITY: 
	* Unlimited personal liability. 
	* Business assets and personal assets are the same. 

* TAXATION: 
	* Profits are taxed once. It’s all personal income tax.
* MANAGEMENT: 
	* You’re your own boss, buddy.
* FUNDRAISING ABILITY: 
	* Very limited to none. Pretty much limited to
personal capital. Banks are wary of sole proprietorship because of liability.

*Let's take a look at our chart*
