## <a name="ibsm">Introduction to Business Structures and Models</a>

You cannot conduct business in a vaccuum. You *have* to interact with others. Understanding exactly *who* you are conducting business with is one of the first steps to empowering yourself in everyday business interactions.


To start making sense of things, we need to answer two of the initial questions:

* What ***kind*** of business?
* What does the business ***do***?

### — Business Structures
Understanding how a business is structured helps us answer the first question of what kind of business we are dealing with. 

*What is a business structure?*

* The framework and/or legal establishment of an entity for conducting business.
* A business structure defines what the business is, but not necessarily what the
business does.
* A business structure answers questions like “Who owns the company?”, “How
can I raise money?” and “What taxes do I owe?”
* You will also hear the term business structure used interchangeably with
“Business Entities,” “Organizational Structures,” “Operating Models,”
“Business Licenses,“ and ”Business Types.”

### — Business Models
Business models help us answer the second questions: what does a particular business do? 

*What is a business model?*

* A design or strategy for how a business should operate. 
* A business model describes what resoruces are needed, how financing works, who the customers are, the likely sources of revenue, who the customers are, etc. 
* Here are some examples of business models in the for-profit sphere:

## <a name="cbs">Common Business Structures</a>  

Time to get down to business! (groan. I'll see myself out). 

*We're going to cover the following common business structures in this unit:*

1. Sole Proprietorships
2. Partnerships
3. Corporations
4. Non-Profit Corporations
5. Others: Cooperatives, B Corps, Benefit Corps, L3Cs

...*but first*

### // HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BUSINESS STRUCTURES
All business structures can be identified by at least the following six elements:

* **OWNERSHIP** — # of people/owners; Can that ownership be transferred?

* **FORMATION** — Requirements to officially register the business.
* **LIABILITY** — Whose assets are at risk?
* **TAXATION** — “How much $#@&! money do I owe the IRS?”
* **MANAGEMENT** — Who makes decisions?
* **FUNDRAISING ABILITY** — Determines the ways you can raise funds (Shares, stock, grants, gifts)

*We're going to use this chart so we don't lose out minds:*

### // 1. SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/MadMax_Sole.jpeg)

* OWNERSHIP:
	* Singular owner.
	* No legal distinction between business and the owner. 
	* No ownership transfer.
* FORMATION: 
	* No requirements, but there are best practices like having a
business banking account and sometimes you need industry-specific licenses
or permits.
* LIABILITY: 
	* Unlimited personal liability. 
	* Business assets and personal assets are the same. 

* TAXATION: 
	* Profits are taxed once. It’s all personal income tax.
* MANAGEMENT: 
	* You’re your own boss, buddy.
* FUNDRAISING ABILITY: 
	* Very limited to none. Pretty much limited to
personal capital. Banks are wary of sole proprietorship because of liability.

*Let's take a look at our chart*

### // 2. PARTNERSHIPS
We're going to cover two types of partnerships: ***General*** and ***Limited.***

agreement.

![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/MadMax_Incorporation.gif)

Whereas sole proprietorships and partnerships can be formed instantaneously with a simple agreement, we're now crossing into the world of incorporation. The rest of the business structures we're going to cover have very specific filing and formation requirements. 

We're going to cover the following types of incorporation:

* Limited Liability Corporations
* C Corporations
* S Corporations
* Non-Profit Organizations 

#### **— LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS**
