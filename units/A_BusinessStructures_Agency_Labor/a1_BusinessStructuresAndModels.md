## <a name="ibsm">Introduction to Business Structures and Models</a>
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/madmax_interaction.gif)

You cannot conduct business in a vacuum. You *have* to interact with others. Understanding exactly *who* you are conducting business with is one of the first steps to empowering yourself in everyday business interactions.


To start making sense of things, we need to answer two initial questions:

* What ***kind*** of business are we dealing with?
* What does the business ***do***?

### — Business Structures
> What ***kind*** of business are we dealing with?

Understanding how a business is structured helps understand what *kind* of business we are dealing with. 

*What is a business structure?*

* The framework and/or legal establishment of an entity for conducting business.
* A business structure defines what the business is, but not necessarily what the
business does.
* A business structure answers questions like “Who owns the company?”, “How
can I raise money?” and “What taxes do I owe?”
* You will also hear the term business structure used interchangeably with
“Business Entities,” “Organizational Structures,” “Operating Models,”
“Business Licenses,“ and ”Business Types.”

*What are some examples from creative practices?*

### — Business Models
> What does the business ***do***?

In its simplest form, a good business model literally tells us what a business does. We're going to cover business models, and business plans, in-depth in *Unit E — Business Planning*. 


*What is a business model?*

* A design or strategy for how a business should operate. 
* A business model describes what resources that are needed, how financing works, who the customers are, the likely sources of revenue, who the customers are, etc. 
* Here are some examples of business models in the for-profit sphere:

## <a name="cbs">Common Business Structures</a>  

Time to get down to business! (groan. I'll see myself out). 

*We're going to cover the following common business structures in this unit:*

1. Sole Proprietorships
2. Partnerships
3. Corporations

...*but first*

### // HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BUSINESS STRUCTURES
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/madmax_tellingapart.gif)

All business structures can be identified by at least the following six elements:

* **OWNERSHIP** — # of people/owners; Can that ownership be transferred?

* **FORMATION** — Requirements to officially register the business.
* **LIABILITY** — Whose assets are at risk?
* **TAXATION** — “How much $#@&! money do I owe the IRS?”
* **MANAGEMENT** — Who makes decisions?
* **FUNDRAISING ABILITY** — Determines the ways you can raise funds (Shares, stock, grants, gifts)

*We're going to use this chart so we don't lose our minds:*

### // 1. SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/MadMax_Sole.jpeg)
> A Sole Proprietorship is one individual or married couple in business alone. Sole proprietorships are the most common form of business structure. This type of business is simple to form and operate, and may enjoy greater flexibility of management, fewer legal controls, and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)


* OWNERSHIP:
	* Singular owner.
	* No legal distinction between business and the owner. 
	* No ownership transfer.
* FORMATION: 
	* No requirements, but there are best practices like having a
business banking account and sometimes you need industry-specific licenses
or permits.
* LIABILITY: 
	* Unlimited personal liability. 
	* Business assets and personal assets are the same. 

* TAXATION: 
	* Profits are taxed once. It’s all personal income tax.
* MANAGEMENT: 
	* You’re your own boss, buddy.
* FUNDRAISING ABILITY: 
	* Very limited to none. Pretty much limited to
personal capital. Banks are wary of sole proprietorship because of liability.

*Let's take a look at our chart*

### // 2. PARTNERSHIPS
We're going to cover two types of partnerships: ***General*** and ***Limited.***

#### **— GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS**
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/madmax_partnership.jpg)
> A General Partnership is composed of 2 or more persons (usually not a married couple) who agree to contribute money, labor, or skill to a business. Each partner shares the profits, losses, and management of the business, and each partner is personally and equally liable for debts of the partnership. Formal terms of the partnership are usually contained in a written partnership agreement. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

* OWNERSHIP:
	* Two or more people
	* Ownership can transfer to new partners (depends on partnership
agreement.)
* FORMATION: 
	* No real requirements, but should be created by a partnership
agreement.
* LIABILITY:
	* Unlimited personal liability for partners.
	* Partners are liable for each other!
* TAXATION
	* Profits are evenly distributed to partners.
	* Taxed once. Taxes pass to individual.
* MANAGEMENT

	* A partnership agreement would spell this out.
	* There are some laws governing what a partner can do.
* FUNDRAISING ABILITY
	* Very limited to none.
	* Partners contribute personal capital.

#### **— LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS**
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/madmax_limited_partnership.jpg)
> A Limited Partnership is composed of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The general partners manage the business and share fully in its profits and losses. Limited partners share in the profits of the business, but their losses are limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are usually not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)


* OWNERSHIP:
	* Two or more people.
	* There are General Partners (Major) and Limited Partners (Minor).
	* Ownership and transfers are defined by partnership agreement.
* FORMATION

	* Unlimited personal liability for the General Partners.
	* Limited liability for the limited partners.
* TAXATION

	* General Partners pay self-employment tax.
* MANAGEMENT
	* Often the General Partners are in charge, but Limited Partners have a say.

### // 3. CORPORATIONS!
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/MadMax_Incorporation.gif)

> "Mo' people, mo' problems" — Tom Hughes

Whereas sole proprietorships and partnerships can be formed instantaneously with a simple agreement, we're now crossing into the world of incorporation. The rest of the business structures we're going to cover have very specific filing and formation requirements. 

> A Corporation is a more complex business structure. A corporation has certain rights, privileges, and liabilities beyond those of an individual. Doing business as a corporation may yield tax or financial benefits, but these can be offset by other considerations, such as increased licensing fees or decreased personal control. Corporations may be formed for profit or nonprofit purposes. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)


We're going to cover the following types of incorporation:

* Limited Liability Corporations
* C Corporations
* S Corporations
* Non-Profit Organizations 

#### **— LLC (LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY)**
> A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is formed by 1 or more individuals or entities through a special written agreement. The agreement details the organization of the LLC, including provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. LLCs are permitted to engage in any lawful, for-profit business or activity other than banking or insurance. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)


* OWNERSHIP:
	* One or more people.
	* Transfer of ownership possible.

#### **— C CORPORATIONS**
> A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable. [[source]](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure)

#### **— S CORPORATIONS**
> An S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.

#### **— NON-PROFIT CORPORATIONS — 501(C)3**
> Nonprofit corporations are organized to do charity, education, religious, literary, or scientific work.
