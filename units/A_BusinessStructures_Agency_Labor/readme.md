# UNIT A	Business Structures, Agency, and Labor
***Summary*** — This unit starts with the basic legal structures used to organize and conduct business in the United States (and in most cases, internationally). We will cover some of the most commonly used business structures including Sole Proprietorships, Partnerships, LLC, S and C Corporations, B Corporations and Not-for-Profit Organizations. Discussion will include defining these structures and how they are formed, examples in creative practice, and discussing the pros and cons of each.

With that starting knowledge, we will dive head-first into Agency and Labor. Or simply put, "How to work with other people." We will go over the legal concept of agency and break down the systems that exist to employ others — and the ethics, laws and best practices that come with each method.
