## <a name=relationships>Relationships</a>

When we talk about agency and labor in this course, we're generally covering the set of rules, guidelines and laws that define the relationship between parties in business. 

It helps us answer the question, "who works for whom?"


As an introduction to this topic, we're going to start things off with  these three primary types of relationships: 

1. **PRINCIPAL AND AGENT**  
	A party who conducts business on behalf of and in the interest of a principal.
	
	*Examples: Lawyers, insurance agents, gallerists*
	
2. **EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE**	
	An agent who works for a principal **AND** whose methods and working
conditions are controlled by the principal.

3. **PRINCIPAL AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR**  
	A party who is **contracted** to do work for a principal, but whose methods and working conditions **are not** controlled by the principal. 

	*Examples: A freelance designer, a general contractor in construction*

This relationships can appear to be straightforward when you're talking about only two or three parties conducting a single piece of business—but few projects are limited to just a few parties. 

***Let's take a look at some examples of projects in creative practices that involve multiple, sometimes complex, relationships:***  

For each of these examples, try to guess how many parties are involved and what their business structures could be. And what are their relationships of these parties to each other?

## <a name="agency">// Defining Agency</a>

The relationships in the prior examples all represent contain some form of an agency relationship. 

###### *— What is agency?*

**AGENCY** — A consensual relationship created by contract or by law where one party, the **principal**, grants authority for another party, the **agent**, to act on behalf of and under the control of the principal to deal with a **third party**.

An agency relationship is **fiduciary** in nature, and the actions and words of an agent exchanged with a third party *bind the principal*.  

###### *— Why is agency important?*

* **Reach** — You can be in two places at once.

* **Augmentation** — You can augment your creative practice utilizing skills and knowledge you don’t personally possess.
 
* **Representation** — You can enable someone who can carry out your wishes and who has has your best interests in mind.
 
* **Employment** — Understanding agency is an essential aspect of being an employee and/or employer.

#### **// Some Helpful Definitions**
* **PRINCIPAL** — The party who authorizes another (an agent) to act on their behalf. A principal could be an individual or a group.

* **AGENT** — The party who is authorized to act on another’s (the principal) behalf. An agent can also be an individual or a group.

* **THIRD PARTY** — Any person or party outside of the two primary parties (principal and agent).

* **FIDUCIARY** — A legal and/or ethical relationship of trust. A person in a fiduciary relationship is obligated to act in the best interest of another.

* **EMPLOYEE** — A person (agent) hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a principal (employer), whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal.

* **INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** — A person hired to perform limited, specific duties for a party according to a contract, for a specific period of time. The independent contractor's work conditions and methods are not strictly controlled by the principal.

#### // The Common Types of Agency

* **General** — Authorized to conduct every kind of business for the Principal.

* **Special** — Authorized to conduct only specific business activities as outlined in a contract.
* **Agent with interest** — The agent possesses interest (owns or controls) some aspects of the Principal’s business.
* **Subagent** — An secondary agent who is agent to both the primary agent and principal.
* **Employee/Employer** — An agent who works for a principal, whose methods and working conditions are controlled by the principal.

*What are some examples we can think of in creative practices?*

## <a name="four">// The Essential Four Components</a>
The are four essential components that help us determine what type and to what extent an agency relationships exists:

1. **FORMATION**
2. **CONTROL**
3. **AUTHORITY**
4. **LIABILITY**

### **// FORMATION**
*How are agency relationships started?*

##### — BY AGREEMENT*

* By express agreement
* Both parties agree to a relationship by verbal or written agreement.
* By implied agreement
* Conduct of both parties expresses an intent to create an agency
relationship

*We will cover agreements in greater details in Unit C

##### — BY RATIFICATION
* A third part sets up the relationship, and the agent and the principal agree.
* Think of this like matchmaking.

##### — BY ESTOPPEL

* A principal's response to a second party's action leads a third party to believe that an agency relationship exists.
	* i.e. If you let someone act for you and go along with it, they can be considered your legal agent.
	* Be careful what you ask someone to do for you.
 
##### — BY OPERATION OF LAW
* Agencies recognized by courts in the absence of a formal agreement.
	* i.e. family relationships, emergency situations

### **// CONTROL**
What level of control does the Principal have over the Agent?

* What is the scope of work or job duties?
* How much direction and control does the principal exercise over the
agent’s work?
* Can the principal determine the agent’s working conditions?
* Is the relationship exclusive?

### **// AUTHORITY**

What is the agent empowered to do?

*Two types:*

* **Actual Authority** — The principal assigns express or implied powers to 
the agent.

* **Apparent Authority** — The principal, knowingly or mistakenly, permits to agent to act with authority they were never expressly granted.
	* This is where agency by estoppel comes in.
	* Essentially, you have to be very clear with your agent on what they can and
cannot do!

### **// LIABILITY**
You could be held responsible for your agent's actions!

* Certan agents are able to enter into legally binding agreements on your behalf.
* You could be held liable for an agent's conduct.
* AHHHHHH!

### — Let's take a look back at our examples from earlier in this lecture. 

### How would you now define the various agency relationships?

## <a name="add">// Addendum</a>
*This addendum includes a question from a student that the instructor had to research and report back to the class.*

> "When employers discourage sharing wages, how does that function legally? I know there’s a degree of cultural stigma to keep in mind around asking people (coworkers or not) about their wages, but is there any factor of that that employers can enforce legally speaking, or any specific legal frameworks that employees or job applicants can use to work around and figure out what employees are actually making?"

In short, the answer is that employees are protected in *most cases* to share their wage and salary information with each other. 

This falls under the category of organizing and collective bargaining protected by the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov) under the National Labor Relations Act. I think this article on GovDocs gives the most concise and clear explanation I've found: 

* [Can Employees Discuss Pay and Salaries?](https://www.govdocs.com/can-employees-discuss-pay-salaries/) · GovDocs
 
*There are some exceptions and items to note:*

* There are some types of government and organizations that do not fall under the NLRB protections. (The GovDocs article provides an explanation as to why). 
* You are broadly protected to *freely discuss* salary or wage as part of organizing activity, but you *cannot force* your co-worker to reveal their salary. This would violate their privacy rights and also is just a real jerk move. 
* Additionally, if you handle payroll or finances for your organization:

	> An employee whose job function involves access to company wage and payroll information may not disclose employee pay information to other employees unless directed to by the employer or an investigating agency. [GovDocs]

So, in most cases, an employer cannot create a company policy prohibiting employees from discussing pay. Importantly, this also applies to discussing **working conditions**—here's an example from the NLRB website: [Protected Concerted Activity.
