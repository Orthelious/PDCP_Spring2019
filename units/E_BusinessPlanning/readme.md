# UNIT E — Business Planning</a>
***Summary*** — The goal of this Unit is to present a surface level entry point into the world of strategic planning, business models, and market analysis. These high-level tools are focused on the forest, not the trees. We will use a series of frameworks to practice taking a nebulous idea and turning it into a realistic, actionable plan. We will focus in particular on Business Plans—for the final project of this course, all students will make and present an individual business plan.   

[E.1]	Business Plans and Models
