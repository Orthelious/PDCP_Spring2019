# [E.1]	Business Plans and Models  

Two parts to this topic:

* Business Models
* Business Plans

## Business Models
You have a great idea, but ideas can easily fail without some consideration of how they will work in the real world. 

The process of figuring out how your idea will work in a market or field is called a **business model**

Let's watch a cheesy video that explains this concept:

### — Starting point: The Profile
We need to first decide who and what we are. 

* What is your idea?
* Who is carrying it out?
* What is your business structure?

### — Building Blocks
We're going to use the following framework from *Business Model Generation* by Alexander Osterwalker and Yves Pigneur. It's complicated on it's face, but another cheesy video will help us figure it out.

* **Customer Segments** — Who is being served by your idea? Are they all the same or can you break them into different types?

* **Value Proposition** — Why do your customer's care? What of value are you offering them?

* **Channels** — How do you get your idea to your customers?

* **Customer Relationships** — What kind of relationship are you maintaining with your customer segments?

* **Revenue Streams** — You got value and customers, now where's the money coming from?
	* Example: Painting (Idea) sold to an art collector (Customer) results in payment (Revenue). 
	
* **Key Resources** — What do you need in order to even *produce* the idea and *reach* those customers?

* **Key Activities** — What are the literal activities you have to undertake to make your idea a reality?

* **Key Partnerships** — Your idea isn't going to come to life in a vacuum. Who are you working with? What partnerships are necessary to make your idea a success?

* **Cost Structure** — The final step. Now that we have all of the prior elements in place, what will it cost to make your idea a reality? This is beyond money—you also have to think about time, people, and effort.

*Here's how it looks all together:*

## Business Plans
Business Models are the theory,business plans are... well... the plan. Our final project for this course is going to be a personalized business plan. 

Here are the elements I'm going to require°:

### 1. Executive Summary
* Who are you?
* What are you doing?
* Why should we care?

### 2. Business Model
* What's your value proposition?
* Who are your customer segments and what is your relationship to them? What channels will you use to reach them?
* What/How are you doing this? What resources do you need and who are your key partners?
* How much will it cost?
* How much will you make?

### 3. Financial Analysis
* What is your operational budget?
* What is the cost structure for your project?
* What kind of revenues can you project?

### 4. Environmental Scan
What are the external factors that affect our model? (We'll cover this more in the marketing unit)

* Market Forces  
* Industry Forces
* Key trends 
* Macroeconomic Forces 

### 5. Timeline

* When is this happening? 

### 6. Risk Analysis 
* What are your biggest obstacles?
* What is critical for your success?
