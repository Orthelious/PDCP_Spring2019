# [E.2]	Elements of Business Strategy,  Market Analysis, and Long-term Planning

This unit is—to be perfectly honest—a cherry-picked collection of business strategy frameworks that I have found the most helpful in creative practices:

* Benchmarking
* SWOT Analysis
* PESTLE Analysis
* SMART Goals
* Logic Models

## Benchmarking
*What it is used for:* To evaluate yourself against the standard. 

Benchmarking is the process by which you define the market or field you want to be in and find others like you. Then analyze similarities and differences to create a standard against which you can measure yourself. 

*Steps*

* Define your field or market. The more specific, the better the benchmark
	2. I am a fine artist creating original installation work about my heritage. 
	3. I am a product designer working in experimental 3-D printed and extruded forms. 
	4. I am an animator who focuses in character design. 
	
* Set the limits of your benchmarking
	1. I am a fine artist working in Chicago
	2. I am a product designer working in the US
	3. I am an animator working in the global animation market
	
* Identify a few competitors most similar to your field, within your preset limits
	1. My competition is Fancy Pants Emerging Art Star
	2. My competition is slightly more experienced Independent Designer
	3. My competition is anyone who does what I do, throughout the world. 
	
* Find the *Points-of-Parity* (How you're similar) and *Points-of-Difference* (How you differ)
	1. (POP) We are both artists that deal with the subject matter of our heritage. (POD) My work shows a much more informed perspective and is noticeably better in execution. 
	2. (POP) We both work in experimental plastics. (POD) While Independent Designer has a few years industry experience, I have more experience in what is at the bleeding edge of the field.    
	3. (POP) We all have the same base-level skills in character design. (POD) My characters have garnered a huge online fanbase and my instagram followers are in the hundreds of thousands.
	 
* Repeat this process until you feel you have a good understanding of what the standards are for your field. 

## SWOT Analysis

*What it is used for:* To analyze your risks and opportunities.

A SWOT analysis is one of the more common business strategy frameworks used. It stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. 

Here's how it looks in a chart:

This is a great framework to put up on a whiteboard and brainstorm with. 

## PESTLE Analysis
*What it is used for:* To analyze trends or forces in your chosen market or field. 

PESTLE stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental.

## SMART Goals
*What it is used for:* As a method to take more nebulous ideas and break them into realistic chunks. 

SMART stands for (I know, everything is a mnemonic):

* **S** - Specific    
* **M** - Measurable  
* **A** - Attainable
* **R** - Relevant
* **T** - Time-oriented

Essentially, as you set goals for yourself and your practice, use this as a 5-question standard. Can it pass each of them? Then its a *smart goal.*

## Logic Models
*What it's used for:* To create a roadmap between your program/practice and it's intended effects. 

This is going to be the wonkiest of the strategies we cover. Logic models are all about tying things together...

Not quite that, but that *is* how I feel most days. 

Here's what a Logic Model looks like:

You start at the ends (inputs and longer-term outcomes) and work your way in!
