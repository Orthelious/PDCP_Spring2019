## Marketing Basics

*WTF is marketing?*

Marketing is hard to pin down as it covers an entire field of business and has numerous connections to activities like public relations, product development, advertising, and more. 

For our purposes, we're going to define marketing the following way:
>"Marketing is the act of connecting customers to products" [[Source]](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/03/01/my-definition-of-marketing/)

Marketing is all about getting your *offering of value* in front of the *right* people.

### — Why is Marketing Important to a Creative Practice?

Because while we all create something of value, it does not automatically get to the right audience. The challenges are:

* How do we get that in front of the right people?
* How do we get them to spend and/or invest (monetarily or emotionally) in what we have?
* How do we continue that relationship long-term?
* How do we accomplish this without burning out or wasting all of our money?

Marketing provides the framework for tackling these challenges. 

### — Basic Marketing Models
There are a ton of different and esoteric marketing models, but they can all be simplified to the following two models:

* **B2C: Business To Customer** — A business delivers something of value to a consumer. 
	* What's an example of this for a creative practice?


* **B2B: Business to Business** — A business delivers something of value to another business. 	
	* What's an example of this for a creative practice?

### — Our Marketing Case Studies
We're going to apply our marketing frameworks to the following four case studies:

* An album by death metal band *Drawn and Quartered*

## The Marketing Mix
The starting point for most traditional marketing is what is commonly referred to as *The Marketing Mix.* It is a set of simple frameworks that help us strategize where, when, why and how we can market our what.

We're going to focus on the two mostly widely used: the four P's and the five C's

### — The Four P's
The four P's of marketing help us put into words how a target market is reached by understanding the blending of four strategic elements. The four elements are **Product, Price, Promotion, and Placement.** 

* **Product** — Product strategy is two-fold. It is firsthand about what makes up the product itself. Secondly, it is about the value (both perceived and real) that a consumer will anticipate for the product. 
	* What are some of the product strategies for our case studies?

* **Promotion** — Promotion is all about how we (the producer) communicate value to a target market. This is where things like advertising, public relations, and sales strategies come into play. 
	* What are some promotional strategies for our case studies? 

* **Price** — We've covered setting price in previous units. How do we determine how much something should cost? 
 * What are some factors we should consider when setting a price for our case studies?

* **Placement** – We know our product, our promotion strategy and our price... but how to we get in front of the target market? Online? Brick and mortar business? A distributor? Placement is all about planting the right plant in the right soil so it will flourish. 
	* Where should we place the products for our case studies?

### — The Five C's
The four P's are all about understanding our relationship between us and the target market. The five C's take a step back and help us look at the market environment *as a whole*. 

The five C's are **Company, Customers, Competitors, Collaborators, and Context.**

* **Company** — Company is all about who we are. Are we a scrappy sole proprietor? A multi-national corporation? A radical cooperative? Knowing *who we are* has a direct effect on *how we communicate to a market.*
	* What are the types of companies represented by our case studies?
	* How does their make-up affect how they communicate to their target market?

* **Customers** — Who are we trying to sell to? How many are there? Are they rich or poor? Fashionable or basic? Can you see them in your mind?
	* Describe the type of customers that would be interested in our case studies.  

* **Competitors** — Who's the competition? How are you similar to them? How do you differ?
	* Name one competitor for each of our case studies. 

* **Collaborators** — Who are our key partners? Do they share a vision with us? Are they just a means to an end? Are they our agent? Are we their agent?
	* Name some key collabs for our casies.  

* **Context** — It would be a terrible idea to try and sell MAGA hats at a live show of *RuPaul's Drag Race.* What is the context in which we are operating? Is it a good fit? Is it a major challenge?
	* Describe the context that each of our case studies may find themselves in.

## Segmentation and the Customer Path
Now that we're prepped on what we're marketing, how we're marketing it and who we're marketing to—we need to find those markets and catch 'em!

**Segmentation** is all about wittling down factors to find the right market to spend your energy on. Think of this like how you would use filters and keywords for a search engine. 

**The Customer Path** refers to how we're going to build a relationship with people in that market. 

### — Segmentation
For segmentation, just remember **STP**

**Segement** » **Target** » **Position**

1. **Segment** — Don't go after everyone! Drop people into categories that make sense. 

	There are four main types of segmentation:

	* **Geographic** - Local? Regional? National? International?
	* **Demographic** - Black? White? Hispanic? Old? Young? Educated? 
	* **Behavioral** - Big spenders? Penny pinchers? Fanatics? First-time buyers? Fashionistas? Minimalists?
	* **Psychographic** — This one is tricky, it's about targeting specific *groups* within a population. So... like juggalos. What are some of the characteristics of *juggalos*?

	*Why are segments important?*  
	— Geographic determines *the size of the market*  
	— Demographic determines *the needs of the consumer*  
	— Behavioral determines *how they will respond to our marketing*  
	— Psychographic determines *the social dimension and gives us context for the group*

2. **Target** — Now we have a ton of segments, but we only have so much time and money. Which of the segments are the most valuable? i.e. who are the best *targets.*

3. **Position** — Now we know *who* we are going after, how do we get in front of them?

### — The Customer Path
Think of the customer path like a black hole — the closer you get, the stronger the connection.

Our target market is just floating out in space, how do we pull them into our orbit?

The elements of the Customer Path are:

#### Awareness » Consideration » Conversion » Loyalty » Advocacy. 

* ***Awareness*** - Think of this like 'catching someone's eye.' How do you make a targeted market aware you exist? A great advertising campaign? A article in a respected publication? Underground word-of-mouth?

	At this stage, you've just made your target market aware of your existence. 

* ***Consideration*** — Ok, they're paying attention... now what? At this stage you need to sell them on what you're offering. They're weighing options, looking at competitors or maybe just not feeling it today... they're considering all their optoions, but you want them to choose you.  

	This stage is the main sell. 

* ***Conversion*** — You did it! They bought in! Maybe they bought your product or even just walked through the door to see your work. The point is—the transaction has happened and you've successfully connected with your market.

	Are you done?

* ***Loyalty*** - Conversion could be fleeting. How do you keep them coming back? How would your stategy need to change?

* ***Advocacy*** - How do you get your customers to love you SO MUCH that they start advocating for you? Create an army of believers to pull more people into your orbit.
