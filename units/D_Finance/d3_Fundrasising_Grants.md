# [D.3] Fundraising: Grants





## Grant Basics*For our purposes, we're going to define grants the following way:*
>The transfer of something of value for a specific purpose or particular use. 

### Grants vs. Gifts*How are grants different from regular gifts?*

* Gifts are **non-reciprocal** * Grants **require performance*** If you receive a grant for an activity, you must carry out that activity or thefunder may ask for the money back.

### Funding Sources
*Where do grants come from?*  
Generally, grants come from three common sources:* **Foundations** — A non-profit, charitable organization that award grants tosupport specific activities.	* Examples:
		* [The Andy Warhol Foundation](https://warholfoundation.org/)
		* [The Kresge Foundation](https://kresge.org/programs/arts-culture)
		* [The Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/programs/arts)
		* [The Guggenheim Foundation](https://www.gf.org/about/fellowship/)* **Corporations** — A corporation may dedicate a portion of funds via asubsidiary non-profit to support specific activities.	* Examples: 
		* [The Coca-Cola Foundation](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/the-coca-cola-foundation)
		* [The PNC Foundation](https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/corporate-responsibility/philanthropy/pnc-foundation.html)
		* [Google Grants](https://www.google.com/grants/)
		* [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/)* **Government** — Tax dollars set aside for specific purposes, awarded as grants.	* Examples: 
		* [The National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/)
		* [The National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/)
		* [Pennsylvania Council on the Arts](https://www.arts.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx)
		* [Allegheny Regional Asset District ](https://radworkshere.org/)

*Where does the money come from?*  Grant funds are generated in a number of ways. Understanding the difference between the sources of funding can help in determining the scale and scope of a request.  * **Foundations**	* From **Endowments** — A principal, invested amount of money that generates interestevery year. That interest is the amount of money that the foundation can use for grants.(A $1m principal produces approx. $50k for grants)	* From **Expendable Gifts** — Unlike an endowment, this principal is spent until the moneydisappears.	* From **Donors** — Some foundations have fundraising campaigns to generate the moneythey use for grants.* **Corporations**	* From business funds, usually profits* **Government**	* From your tax dollars

### Types of Grants
Here are three of the most common types of grants: * Project/Program Grants — Funds a specific project or supports a distinct program	* Example: [Creative Capital](https://creative-capital.org/)* General Operating Support — Funds overhead costs like salaries, rent, etc.	* Example: [The Heinz Endowments](http://www.heinz.org/)* Artist Grants or Fellowships — Grants designed specifically to support anindividual’s practice or mission.	* Such as the [MacArthur Foundation Fellows Program](https://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/)

### Receiving Grant Funds

*What business structure do I need to get a grant?*

* Technically, Any of the business structures we’ve discussed can get grants.	* Grants to non-profits are by far the most common. 
		* *Why do you think this is the most common?*	* Grants to for-profits are more common with government grants.	* Grants to individuals are hard to find, but not uncommon.*How will grant funds affect your taxes?*There are different tax considerations for grants based on your business structure:* **Non-profits** — Grants are considered non-taxable income* **For-profit** — Taxes may apply, but taxable deductions are possible depending on how the funds are spent. * **Individual**— Taxes may apply, but taxable deductions are possible depending on how the funds are spent. * **For-profits and individuals via fiscal sponsor** — No taxes. You essentially are 'loaned' a non-profit's ability to be tax-free. 

*Fiscal Sponsorship?*  
Individuals, partnerships and corporations can receive tax-deductible gifts ifthey have **fiscal sponsorship**.* **Fiscal Sponsorship** — Sometimes called a fiscal conduit, is when a non-profitorg enables you to use their non-profit status, for a fee, to accept donationsand apply for grants.	* Example: [Fractured Atlas](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/)

### The Grant Proposal Process
*Each grant maker is slightly different, but here is the general process:*

1. Come up with a fundable idea1. Seek out funding opportunities1. If possible, meet with a program officer1. Apply1. Send a LOI — Letter of Inquiry  *and/or*1. Respond to an RFP — A Request for Proposals1. If awarded, carry out the activity1. Send in a Grant Report documenting project outcomes

##### Grant-writing tips
*We'll go over this more in D.6, but here are some overall tips:*  What makes a good grant?* A strong argument for funding necessity* Understanding a funder's priorities and goals* Having clearly articulated goals and outcomes* Writing for the right audience* Consistency in language, tone and concept.* Following the RFP requirements. * Having a professional budget that matches the proposal narrative

##### Stewardship
Be a good steward of funding!* ***Always*** act ethically when spending grant funds* Keep an open dialogue with your program officer* Invite funders to see the work!* Credit funders appropriately on programs and signage. Many funders have these requirements in the grant award agreements. 
* Follow-up. After completeing a grant and turning in the report, connect with teh pgoram officer to check-in and keep the relationship going. 

### Some general tips

1. **Most funders don't like taking risks.** Start with smaller grants and build that relationship. Once a funder sees you as a good bet, then go big and make the major ask. 

2. **Relationships with program officers pays off.** Their job is to give people money, but remember that they are—in best-case scenarios—your collaborator, not your bank account. 

3. **Don't get discourages if you fail! Ask for feedback.** There are many reasons why you did not get funded—it's not automatically because your idea was bad. You'll only find out by following up for feedback. 

4. **Apply!** You'll never know if you don't try.
