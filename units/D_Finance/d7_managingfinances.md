## Managing Finances

*From a high-level, we're going to cover the following:*

* Banking* Spending* Receiving* Tracking

### — Banking
* If your creative practice is going to be a significant source of income,separate it from your personal finances and sign up for a business banking account.* Remember, it’s best to keep personal and business assets separate.* You can sign up for a business bank account through most banks — even asa Sole Proprietor.

### — Spending* **CASH** — Keep track of cash. Separate business cash from personal cash.Deposit cash ASAP.* **CHECKS** — Use your business bank account checks, not personal checks.This is especially important if more than one person needs access to theback account.* **CHARGING** — Sign up for business-specific credit cards and debit cards. Donot use you personal cards if possible. This is especially important if youhave multiple people using the same credit card.

### — Receiving* **GETTING PAID** — You need to document the whole payment process:	* Have a written agreement in place	* Send an invoice to request payment	* When you receive the payment, send a receipt	* Check your bank records to make sure the check/payment clears.* Always deposit money as soon as possible.

### — Tracking* **RECORDING** — Decide if you will use Accrual basis or Cash method for accounting.	* **Accrual Basis** — Transaction recorded when the money is earned, but not yet received.	* **Cash Basis** — Transaction recorded when money is received.	* You can’t do both. You have to choose one.	* Most people choose accrual.* **SAVE THE EVIDENCE** — You need to save contracts, receipts, invoices, bank statements…anything that is evidence of money in and money out.
* **USE A SYSTEM** — You need to have a clear, organized system in place.	* At the bare minimum, use a spreadsheet.	* It’s worth it to use financial management software like Quickbooks.	* It’s best to use something like Quickbooks + working with an Accountant.

## Financial Planning
*Now that you have the money, what do you do with it?*

In terms of simplicity and accuracy to creative practices, I really enjoy this article from the Creative Independent: 
>[An Artist's Guide to Financial Planning](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/an-artists-guide-to-financial-planning/)

From the article, we're going to cover two items: Budgeting and Investing. 

### — Budgeting

![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/d7_budget.png)
* Budgeting is about **short term financial security*** From the article: The **50 / 30 / 20 Budget**A 50/30/20 budget is based on three simple categories:* Obligations: how much you have to spend (50% of your income)* Discretionary: any time you pay for a thing out in the world (30% of yourincome)* Savings: the money that you don’t spend each month, which is building up yourfinancial security (20% of your income)

### — Investing
*In other words, getting your money to make money.*

* Investing is about **long-term financial security (i.e. retirement)**
* Investing takes advantage of the positive aspect of generating interest on a principal. * Compounding interest isn’t just about debt. You can utilize it to invest and makemuch more money.* Investing is pretty easy to do these days, but should always be done with ahealthy dose of caution and advice.*For example:*
* You decide to save $500 per year.	* If you invest in a retirement account— In 30 years, you will have $54k (7% interest)	* If you don’t invest, but just save — In 30 years, you will have just $15k
