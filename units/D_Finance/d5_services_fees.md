# [D.5] Earned Income: Services, Rates and Fees

In the second half of our earned income topic, we're going to cover the concept of services and how to set rates and fees. 


## Service Basics
##### What is a service? 
Let's go back to our definition: 
> **Services** — Actions performed by one party for another party, for a set **fee**.

Let's put this in the context of some creative practices:

*Who can give a personal example of a time they've performed a service in a creative practice?*

## Service Contracts
The parameters of a service agreement should be set forth in a service contract. 

**— The primary factors to consider in any service contract:*** **Scope of work** — The service should involve which specific activities? Which activities are not included?* **Deliverables** — The specific result of the service. Literally what is delivered to the client upon completion of the service.* **Term** — How long do you have to complete the work? What are the deadlines?Are there milestones along the way?* **Support** — Who’s responsible for maintaining deliverables? Is the client providing any type of support (i.e. office space, materials, etc.)* **Fee/Rate for service** — What do you charge a client?

## Setting Fees and Rates
*Basically...*

*But for serious...*

**— Three main types of fees:**
* **Flat** — One lump sum for the whole project.* **Rate** — A fee based on units of time worked. i.e. hourly, daily, etc.* **Variable** — Changes based on situations or markets. For example: a slidingscale based on company size.You can mix and match these different fee types according to the project.

**— Factors to consider when setting a fee/rate:**
* **Value proposition** — What is the promise of value for your service?* **Cost-plus pricing**— What is the price beyond cost-to-produce. What is the markup?* **Rarity and demand** — What is the market for your services?* **Competitors' pricing** — What do your competitors charge? How is your servicesimilar? How is it different?* **Opportunity cost** — By taking on one client, what alternatives do you lose out on?* **Tax burden** — What taxes will you owe from a job? Did you know that contractorspay higher taxes?!* **Type of deliverables** — What are you delivering to the client? What is the value of that deliverable? Is it full IP transfer? Is it just a consultation?

**— Calculating rates and fees**

*Let's do an exercise in calculating a base hourly rate:*

1. Start with the **(A) workable hours** in a year: 2,000
	* This assumes a 40hr work week and 2 weeks of vacation.
2. Calculate your **(B) cost of living** by estimating your annual expenses for the year.
	* Start with monthly estimates like rent, food, entertainment, debt. Sub-total everything and multiply by 12 to get the annual cost. 
	* Add in any other annual expenses like health insurance, car insurance, etc. 
	* This is your estimated *cost of living.* You need to make this much money to survive. 

3. Assuming you're breaking even in life, we'll assume you're going to make exactly enough money to cover your living expenses. So, for this exercise *cost of living* = **(C) net income**

3. Estimate your tax burden based on your (C) net income. 
	* We're going to cover calculating tax rates later, but for this exercise we'll use an *very approximate* 18%
	* Calculate what you would have paid in taxes and add that to your (C) net income. 
	* For example: For a 18% tax rate, divide (C) by 82%.
	* The final number is your **(D) gross annual income.** 

5. (D) Gross Annual Income / (A) Workable hours = (E) Your base hourly rate. 

*Confusing? Here's how it look's in practice*

		(A) Workable hours — 2,000    

		(B) Cost of living — $32,880   

			* $12,000 - apartment rent ($1,000/month)
			* $3,600 - studio rental ($300/month)
			* $1,440 - utilities ($120 / month)
			* $960 - internet ($80/month)
			* $720 - cell phone ($60/month)
			* $2,400 - groceries ($200/month)
			* $2,160 - eating out ($180/month)
			* $3,000 - health insurance ($250/month)
			* $1,200 - Clothing ($100/month)
			* $3,600 - student loans ($300/month)
			* $1,800 - Misc costs ($150/month)

		(C) Net Income — $32,880 [Net income needed = (B) cost of living]	
		
		(D) Gross Income - $40,097
			* Tax rate of 18%
			* $32,880 / .82 = $40,097 

		(E) Base Hourly Rate — $20!
			* (D) $40,097 / (A) 2,000 hours = $20 per hour

			
So, to maintain that lifestyle you need to make $20 per hour at your job. 
****

Let's play with the numbers a bit. Let's say you only work 1,500 hours per year:

		(A) Workable hours — 1,500    

		(B) Cost of living — $32,880   

			* $12,000 - apartment rent ($1,000/month)
			* $3,600 - studio rental ($300/month)
			* $1,440 - utilities ($120 / month)
			* $960 - internet ($80/month)
			* $720 - cell phone ($60/month)
			* $2,400 - groceries ($200/month)
			* $2,160 - eating out ($180/month)
			* $3,000 - health insurance ($250/month)
			* $1,200 - Clothing ($100/month)
			* $3,600 - student loans ($300/month)
			* $1,800 - Misc costs ($150/month)

		(C) Net Income — $32,880 [Net income needed = (B) cost of living]	
		
		(D) Gross Income - $40,097
			* Tax rate of 18%
			* $32,880 / .82 = $40,097 

		(E) Base Hourly Rate — $27!
			* (D) $40,097 / (A) 1,500 hours = $27 per hour
****

Let's change the format of your rate. Let's say you charge a day rate instead of hourly. 

		(A) Workable days in a year — 250
			* Assuming 5 days a week.
			* Assuming 2 weeks vacation.    

		(B) Cost of living — $32,880   

			* $12,000 - apartment rent ($1,000/month)
			* $3,600 - studio rental ($300/month)
			* $1,440 - utilities ($120 / month)
			* $960 - internet ($80/month)
			* $720 - cell phone ($60/month)
			* $2,400 - groceries ($200/month)
			* $2,160 - eating out ($180/month)
			* $3,000 - health insurance ($250/month)
			* $1,200 - Clothing ($100/month)
			* $3,600 - student loans ($300/month)
			* $1,800 - Misc costs ($150/month)

		(C) Net Income — $32,880 [Net income needed = (B) cost of living]	
		
		(D) Gross Income - $40,097
			* Tax rate of 18%
			* $32,880 / .82 = $40,097 

		(E) Base Hourly Rate — $160!
			* (D) $40,097 / (A) 250 days = $160 per day
