*A quick definition:*
>Proposals–colloquially called grants–are technical documents that appeal for resources such as money, space, and equipment. [[source]](https://writingcommons.org/open-text/genres/professional-business-and-technical-writing/1245-proposal-writing-basics

## Writing a good proposal
The best advice I can give for preparing a successful proposal is to be organized, clear, and to seek feedback. Grant proposals are judged on a number of factors: clear writing, feasibility of the idea, sensibility of the budget, etc. 

The best way to learn is to apply. 

*...but we're going to cover some tips and best practices.* 

We're going to use the following case examples throughout this unit: 

* An artist applying for a public artwork
* A collective applying for a large music festival 
* A designer applying for a community-based, collaborative project
* An artist applying for travel funding to attend a residency
* A small non-profit jumpstarting a new exhibition series
* A large non-profit planning a biennial

### Pre-Proposal Steps
1. **Analyze resources** - What does your creative practice have on hand? What do you need?
2. **Set project/program goals** — What are you trying to accomplish with this funding? How will it affect your practice and career?
3. **Set a timeline** — How much time do you have to find funding? How long will the project last?
4. **Identify a funder** — This could also be the first step, often an RFP can inspire a project or program. The important step here is to *match* your project to an appropriate fund. 

### Funding Research
1. **Identify the funding stream or likely funder**
	* Example: [The Foundation Center](https://foundationcenter.org/) 

2. **Look at that funder's cycles and RFPs**
	* Example: [Creative Capital](https://creative-capital.org/)
3. **Check terms and conditions**
	* Example: [The NEA Art Works program](https://www.arts.gov/grants-organizations/art-works/grant-program-description)
4. **Look at past grants awarded**
	* Example: [A.W. Mellon](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/)
5. **Identify connections and program officers** 
	* [The Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/)

### Aligning and Translating
Ask yourself the following questions as you prepare your proposal:

1. Do you meet all the RFP requirements?

2. Do you match the organization's goals?
3. Can you 'translate' your project into the language and tone of the funder?
	* Don't automatically change your project, translate your project.
4. What could a long-term relationship with this funder look like?

### General Writing Tips
1. Start with your **case for funding**
  * Can you clearly and concisely describe the project/program?
  * You should be able to verbally describe your proposal is less than 30 seconds. 
2. Create a proposal checklist

3. Write for your audience

4. Write multiple drafts
5. Have peers review and give feedback
6. Check for consistency of language and concepts
7. Run sepllchek
8. Triple check your proposal checklist before submission

9. Create a language bank for the next proposal

### Budgets
*Format*

1. Proposal budgets will typically look like an income statements—they focus on expenses and income.
3. Check to see if your funder has a premade budget template
	* Example: Knight Foundation Budget Template
4. Looking closely at the RFP for budget conditions
	* Example: NEA Art Works 
5. Above all, make sure your budget matches your proposal. 

*General tips*

1. Build in items that you may need later

2. Find ways to pay people
3. Don't get greedy
4. Don't be a cheapskate either
5. Consider any in-kind support. 

Let's build some budgets!
