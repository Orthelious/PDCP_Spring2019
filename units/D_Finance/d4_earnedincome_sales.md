# [D.4] Earned Income: Sales and Price

This is the first of two units on the concept of **earned income**. Prior units covered how to raise capital through **contributed income** (i.e. grants, gifts and—to a degree— investments). 

## Earned Income Basics
##### What is earned income?
> **Earned income** is the value delivered to your business that was the direct result of business transaction—the sale of goods and/or services. 

*How is earned income different from contributed and invested income?*

* Earned income is money you’ve literally **earned** from a transaction. Two or more parties exchanged something of value.  
* This income is **taxable**

*» How is this different from contributed income like gifts and grants?*

*» How is this different from the capital received from from investments and loans?*

##### According to the IRS, there are two ways to get earned income:
* You work for someone who pays you
* You own or run a business

### Goods and Services
The majority of earned income comes from the sale of goods and/or services. 

* **Goods** — Property, in a fixed state, that is sold by one party to another for a set **price**.
* **Services** — Actions performed by one party for another party, for a set **fee**.

*— What are some examples of goods?*  

*— What are some examples of services?*  

*— Can you think of an example that incorporates both a good and a service?*

##### Let's put this in the context of creative practices. Time to play...

*Is it a good? A service? Or both?*

* A sculpture
* A film
* An article for a magazine
* Providing vocals at a recording session
* A music license
* A theatrical performance
* A photo shoot for a magazine spread
* Curation of an exhibition
* A film screening
* A design consultation
* An architectural rendering
* Rigging an animated model

## Sale and Price

### The basics of every sale

*— Two basic types of sales:** **Direct** — The seller deals directly with the buyer.* **Indirect** — A sale made via a third party.	* Who can think of an example of a third party?	* What’s the advantage for the third party? (Spoiler: Commission!	* Always keep in mind who the third party is working for.

*— The basic elements of every sale:** **Two or more parties** — Who is involved in this sale?*** A consideration** — What is being sold?* **The transfer of goods** — When and how is ownership exchanged?* **Evidence of sale** — How do we know the sale took place?* ***PRICE***

*— Factors to consider when setting price:*
* **Value Proposition** — What is the promise of value for your good?* **Cost-plus pricing** — What is the price beyond cost-to-produce. What is themarkup?* **Rarity and demand** — How many/much of your good is there? Do people want your good?* **Competitors' pricing** — What do your competitors charge? How are yourgoods similar? How is it different?* **Opportunity cost** — By selling this good, what alternatives do you lose out on?* **Tax burden** — What taxes will you owe from the sale* **Type of goods** — What are you delivering to the buyer? What is the value of that good? Does it come with full IP transfer? Is it just a license?

*These factors cannot be considered in a vacuum. In order to create a justifiable and defensible price for your work, you have to take into consideration **market value**.*

## The market value of art
Market value is essentially just the amount for which something can be sold on a given market. 

*In what market are the following items valued and sold?*

* Cars
* Stocks
* Cattle
* Music
* Bananas
* Banana hammocks

### Determining Market Value 

Price for generic goods is primarily set by a market’s supply and demand. In general:* More demand + less supply = higher prices* Less demand + more supply = lower pricesBut the goods produced by creative practices can range from generic to quite complex. Trying to determine the market value of art can be elusive, confounding, and is often secretive. 

— *Basic factors for determining the market value of a piece of art: (via [Artnet](https://www.artnet.com/auctions/Pages/Common/Help/HowToValueArt.aspx))*

* **Condition** — Is the art in the same condition as when it was made? Has itbeen altered? Restored? If so, by whom? Has the integrity of the work beenmaintained?* **Provenance** — The sales and acquisition history of an object. How much hasit sold for? Who has owned it?* **Comparables** — What do similar works (by the same artist) sell for?Within the same medium? Within the same genre?
* **Subject Matter** — Is the object’s subject matter unique or part of a largerbody of work? A genre? A movement? Is it emblematic of an importantperiod or moment of that artist’s career?* **Rarity** — The supply. How often and how many works by the artist appear onthe market? Is this a singular work, an element of that work, or an edition?* **Demand** — Is there a market eager to obtain the work?

Let's take a deeper dive with this video I came across literally yesterday from Christie's Education:

While that video was a good examination of individual price for a work, let's zoom out a bit and examine how the art market operates as a whole:
