# [D.2] Fundraising: Debt Financing, Investments, and Gifts

We're going to discuss four different methods for **raising funds.** In this topic we'll cover:

1. Debt Financing
2. Investments
2. Gifts

## Debt Financing

Put simply, debt financing is:* A way to raise money* When people give you money, but you don’t give up ownership* You usually have to pay the money back plus the interest.
* The most common type of debt financing is a **loan.**

###### Pros:* You can raise money without having to give up ownership in your business.* Loan payments are usually predictable and can be planned for.* You can live beyond your means.###### Cons:* It’s hard to get a good loan without collateral (next slide.)* Loan payments can deplete your cash.* Lender’s have no real stake in your success. They just want to get paid.* In the end, because of interest, you end up paying more.* Defaulting (failing to pay) on a loan can have serious consequences.

### The Elements of a Loan:* **Collateral** — Something pledged as security of a payment.* **Loan Amount** — The amount borrowed. This is called the Principal* **Loan term** — The amount of time you have to pay the money back.* **Interest Rate** — What percentage you’ll pay back in addition to the loanamount (Principal).  

	*These rates can be:*	* **Simple** — Never changes. You the same payment every month until themoney is paid back.	* **Compounding** — Interest upon paid interest+Principal! (Think StudentLoans)	* **Variable** — Change according to market forces

### Common Types of Loans* **Amortized Loan** — A loan with schedule payments that consists of both the principaland the interest.* **Deferred Payment Loan** — A loan where the borrower is allowed to have the moneynow, but start to make payments at an agreed upon future date.* **Bond** — This is used in investments. You (The investor) loan a company (the bond issuer)the principal and they pay you the interest on a regular basis.* **Line of credit** — A preset amount a lender or bank has agreed to give you. You can drawfrom it when you need it, up to the maximum amount. This is what Credit Cards are for.

## Investments
*For our purposes we're going to define investments as follows:*

>**Investment**: Trading a percentage of ownership for money.

***Why do people invest in a company?**** To have access to company profits without doing the work.* To exercise some control over the company.***Why do companies want investors?***
* It’s an option to raise funds without resorting to debt financing, selling offassets, or cutting expenses.

### Two common investment situations1. **Equity*** You own a portion of the company, and therefore are entitled to a portion of the profits.* You are also responsible for a portion of the losses.* This is common for private companies like Partnerships, LLC’s, S Corps and non-publicC Corps2. **Stocks*** If you are a public C Corp, you can sell shares in your company.* Shareholders control is based on the percentage of shares owned.* Shareholders are not responsible (or have limited responsibility) for losses.* This option is only available to publicly traded companies!

## Gifts
*For our purposes we're going to define gifts as follows:*

> **Gifts**: When something of value is given from one party to another without reciprocation. 

*Who can receive gifts?*

* Anyone. The real question is: who gets taxed?	Gifts to:	* An individual — The **donor** pays tax (if the gift is over $15k)	* A for-profit business — The **donor** pays the tax (if the gift is over $15k)	* A not-for-profit organization — Tax-deductible for the donor! Tax-free forthe organization!

*In most cases in creative practices when we talk about gifts we're talking about tax-deductible donations*

### Tax-Deductible Gifts

*Tax-deductible gifts fall broadly into two categories:*  

* **Monetary*** **In-kind** — The donation of physical property or of services.*Types of non-profit gifts:*  
*~as classified on financial statements~*  

* **Unrestricted** — Given to the organization with no real conditions* **Temporarily Restricted** — Given for a specific purpose or intent* **Permanently Restricted** — Org can’t spend the principal, but any interest the gift generates, they can spend. This is what powers endowments.
