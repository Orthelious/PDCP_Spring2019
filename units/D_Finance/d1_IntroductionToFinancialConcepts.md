## Introduction to Financial Concepts
In order to dive into the different aspects of the finance unit, such as sales, fundraising, etc. we need to first understand some basic terminology and concepts: 

### Finance Terminology

### Round One: Assets and Liabilities
* Assets — The economic resources that you have. This can include inventory,cash, supplies, furniture, equipment, trademarks, copyrights, patents…	Anything that adds to the ***value of the business or can be sold to make money.***

* Liabilities — This is what you owe to others. Liabilities include any debt accrued by the business, any money you owe others, loans, credit card bills, rent, mortgages, etc.	Two types: ***Current*** and ***long-term.***
	
###### *— Of the following examples, which is an asset? Which is a liability? Both?*

### Round Two: Income, Expense, Capital, Debt Financing, Owner's Equity

* **Income** — Money received for work (sales or services) or capital.* **Expenses** — A cost incurred in order to operate. There are two main types: fixedand variable.* **Capital** — The money or wealth needed to produce goods and services.* **Debt Financing** — Borrowing money without giving up ownership	* **Debt** is a type of **Capital*** **Owner’s Equity** — The **value** of a company. 
	* OE = Assets - Liabilities	* **Owner’s Equity** is a type of **Capital**

###### — What are some examples of...
	
* Income?
* An expense?
* Capital?
* Debt financing?
* Owner's Equity?

### Round Three: Profit, Loss, Cash Flow, Valuation, Appreciation, Depreciation
* **Profit and Loss** — When your income - expenses equals a positive number, it’s a profit. When it’s negative, it’s a loss.* **Cash Flow** — The monthly movement of funds, including both income and expenses.* **Valuation** — The monetary worth of something. Literally, its value.* **Appreciation and Depreciation** — The increase or decrease in value of an asset over time.

## Financial Reports
Financial reports are the uniform documents that help you understand the financial health of your business. Financial reporting consists primarily of a few different types of **financial statements:**

* **Balance Sheet**
	* For nonprofits this is called a **Statement of Financial Position**

* **Income Statement**
	* For nonprofits this is called a **Statement of Financial Activities**

* **Cash Flow Statement**
	* For nonprofits this is called a **Statement of Financial Activities**

*In addition to these three primary financial statements, nonprofits also have the **Statement of Functional Expenses***


### BALANCE SHEET* The balance sheet shows the company’s worth **over a specific period oftime.*** It consists of **Assets**, **Liabilities**, and **Owner’s Equity*** Ideally: ASSETS = LIABILITIES + EQUITY* Put another way: What you own (ASSETS) - what you owe (LIABILITIES) = your company’s value and wealth (OWNER’S EQUITY)

### INCOME STATEMENT* The income statement shows both the company’s **Income** and **Expenses** over a specific period of time.* The income statement shows if a company is making a **Profit** or a **Loss**.* The formula is simple: **Income** - **Expenses** = **Profit** (+) or **Loss** (-)

### CASH FLOW STATEMENT* The cash flow statement records any money (cash + cash equivalents) thatcomes in and out over a specific period of time.* It shows where money is being spent and where it is being gained.

### STATEMENT OF FUNCTIONAL EXPENSES (nonprofit ONLY)
* The Statement of Functional Expenses further breaks out a nonprofit's expenses into three categories:
	* **Administration and management** — Also called "overhead", these are expenses like salaries, benefits, rent, utilities, etc. that are everyday costs of running the organization and do not have a specific program or purpose.  
	* **Fundraising** — Gotta spend money to make money. Those expenses need to fall here. An example could be the expenses of a fundraising gala. 
	* **Programs** — These are expenses incurred to carry out the mission and purpose of your organization.

*Why the extra effort to break out expenses?*

* It's a necessary aspect of a nonprofit's annual reporting requirements.
