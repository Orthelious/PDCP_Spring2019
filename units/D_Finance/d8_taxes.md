# [D.8] Taxes

>Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.

>— Benjamin Franklin, in a letter to Jean-Baptiste Leroy, 1789

Y'all, we ain't dead yet. So we gotta pay taxes. 

From a high-level, we’re going to cover the following:* Tax Levels
* Tax Rates
* Employee vs. Self-Employed
* Deductions
* Filing

## Tax levels

*Three levels of taxes*
* Federal* State* Local — Including County, City, Township, etc.

## Tax Rates

**Corporations (and Non-Profits)*** Corporations are considered “people” — i.e. they have to file their own taxesindependent of the individuals who run them.* In the interest of time and sanity, we’re not going to cover corporate taxes.**Individuals*** Every individual in this country that earns money must pay income tax.* There are other specific taxes, but we’re going to focus on income tax as it’s themost relevant.* For tax rates, let’s visit the [IRS](https://www.irs.com/articles/2018-federal-taxrates-personal-exemptions-and-standard-deductions)

*This video from Vox best explains how these tax rates work:*

## Employee vs. Self-Employed

**Employees*** If you’re an employee, the income you receive is a **Salary** or **Wage**.**Self-Employed**

* If you are Self-Employed, your income is all considered **Business Income**.

### — Employees* Relatively straightforward.* You receive a wage or salary from an employer.* Your employer withholds money from your paycheck for things like socialsecurity and medicare.* Your employer will send you a W-2 that outlines your earnings and what waswithheld (subtracted from your pay and sent to the government).

### — Self-Employed* Not so straightforward…* There are two major considerations:	* Hobby vs Business	* Business Structure

**Hobby vs. Business** — Does the government consider your practice a hobbyor a business?* Are you making a profit? Yes? — Probably a business* Does the profit represent more than 2% of your income? — It’s a business* If it’s a business, you have to report the income to the IRS and pay taxes.* If it’s a hobby, you normally don’t.

**Business Structures** — The type of business structure affects the types of taxes you pay.* Sole P — Everything is considered one income.* One-member LLC — The IRS treats you like a Sole P. It’s all one income.* Partnerships — You pay income tax for the % of the partnership you own.	* For example, if you own 10% of the partnership, you pay income tax on that10% of the profits.* Multi-Member LLC or S Corp	* An LLC can be a pass-through (Works like a Partnership)	* Or you can be your own employee (Pay both personal income tax andcorporate tax for the LLC)

**The tax implications of Employee vs. Self-Employed are pretty major**Employees:* You just pay income tax — Usually 12% & 22% on your taxable income.* Your Employer has already taken care of the **employment** taxes:	* What they withhold is the part what **you pay**  into social security and medicare: Approx 7.5%	* They **also have to pay** into social security and medicare: Approx 7.5%Self-Employed:
* You pay income tax PLUS all of the employment taxes.* That’s the (usually) 12 & 22% **PLUS** approx. 15% (7.5%+7.5%).* Your tax burden could be almost **27-37%.**[Let’s look at a tax calculator…](https://www.taxact.com/tools/self-employed-calculator#)

## Deductions
What is considered taxable income essentially just refers to your **profits**.* Remember from Finance Basics: Income - Expenses = Profits* **Deductions** reduce your taxable income.* So, in a way… **Yearly Income - Deductions = Taxable Income*** The lower the **Taxable Income**, potentially the **less taxes you have to pay**.

**» Automatic Deductions**

First, there are certain categories that the government will automatically not tax, therefore lowering your taxable income. 

These include things like retirement account contributions.

**» Applied Deductions**

Then we have to apply deductions for **personal income** taxes. There are two methods for applying deductions: **Standard** and **Itemized****— Standard** = An set amount of money you get to automatically deduct.* The government determines what this amount is.* What’s your standard deduction? Back to the [IRS site](https://www.irs.com/articles/2018-federal-tax-rates-personal-exemptions-and-standard-deductions)!
**— Itemized** = Listing out and adding up each individual deduction you qualify for.* If your itemized deductions **are less than** the standard deduction, you have to use the standard deduction.For personal income, you can only pick **one method**: standard or itemized. Pick the one that **saves you the most money.**

For **Business deductions**, you apply these deductions ***IN ADDITION TO*** your personal deduction.

*What are deductible business expenses?*
*Here's a short list:** Materials and supplies* Studio expenses (rent + utilities)* Advertising* Travel* Vehicle expenses* Fees paid (To enter competitions, fairs, etc)* Vendor fees (paypal, etc)* Contract fees (That you pay to other contractors)* Large equipment (Like a laptop, table saw, welder, loom, etc)* Legal and professional services (Lawyers, accountants, etc* Repairs and maintenance (of things like your equipment)* Cell phone costs* Education costs* Conference expenses* Relevant cultural events* Books, magazines and reference material* Film and processing* Framing* Home office expenses* Software subscriptions* Business insurance expenses* Business meals* Business gifts* Office supplies* Taxes (other than income tax)* Tax preparation fees* Postage* Couriers* Internet

**— Itemizing expenses in creative practice**
		
	$5,000 (earned from a sale of artwork)		MINUS	$4,000 (Deductible expenses used to create the artwork.)		EQUALS	$1,000 (Taxable Income)	INCOME TAXES THAT APPLY: 12% Income + 14% Self Employment	
		— WITH DEDUCTIONS, YOU PAY IN TAXES: $260	
		— WITHOUT DEDUCTIONS, YOU PAY IN TAXES: $1,300

**Regular Employees**: Once a year**Self-Employed**: Quarterly

I'm going to cheat and just refer all of you to this *excellent* article on how to do your taxes as an artist. The author does a far better job than me explaining how the various forms and filing work:
