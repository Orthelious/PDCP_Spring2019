# [G.1] Presentation Skills
You're all in college and have had to give a presentation as some point for a class, club, event, etc.

So, for this section, we're going to focus on some general tips that will make us *better* presenters and public speakers. 

Two sections to this topic:

1. General Tips
2. Lightning Presentations!

## General tips
### Know your audience

* Never give a canned presentation. Always adapt it for who you are speaking to. 
* Is it a technical crowd? A crowd well-versed in your medium? Are they clueless about your medium?
* If the presentation is not aligned with your audience they will tune out. 

### Have a literal agenda
* Presentations are stories. Have a beginning, a middle, and an end. 
	* You could even share the table of contents with the crowd with a literal agenda slide. 
* Have a theme to tie everything together
* Have a point

### Dress for comfort (mental and physical) 
* This is highly specific to gender presentation and expectation, so take this with a grain of salt. 
* Dress in a way that makes you feel comfortable in your own skin. Discomfort shows on stage. 
* Dress in a way that makes you feel good about yourself. 
* Dress for the occasion
	* If you don't know — ask. 

### Slow down
* We all have a tendency to motormouth when we're nervous. 
* Some tools to help you slow down:

	1. Pause for effect
	2. Play a video to give yourself a break
	3. Take a drink of water
	4. Take a moment to lock eyes with three audience members
  
### No middle-school dancing
* Don't bounce from foot-to-foot like an uncomfortable tween at a middle-school dance. 
* Widen your stance for stability
* Pivot on your foot to emphasize a point (and get some of those leg jitters out)

### No wand waving, Harry Potter
*I'm super guilt of this*

* If you have a prop (a pointer) and you make a lot of expressive hand gestures, you can end up looking like you're casting a spell. 

### Don't fall prey to self-deprecation 
*I'm extremely guilty of this*

* People don't find self-deprecation funny or modest—they usually find it sad. 
* This is ok if you're making a humorous point, but in general avoid self-deprecating on stage. 
* Project confidence. 

### Breath, stretch and do verbal warm-ups
* Be present in your body — do some basic stretches
* Loosen your face with Lemon Face/Lion Face
* Play the AEIOU game:
	* Work your way through the consonants follwoing each letter with one of the vowels
	* BA BE BI BO BU
	* CA CE CI CO CU
	* DA DE DI DO DU
	* Do this as fast as possible

### Slides are visual aids not screenplays 
* Slides convey information, you convey context. 
* Don't make text heavy slides. They will compete for you audiences attention.

### Use notes to keep on track. 
* All slide software comes with the ability to include speaker notes. Use notes to keep on track. 
* Even the most skilled bands still make a written set-list to use on stage.
* If you're going to just read from notes, practice your reading voice.

### Q & A's will always feel scary
* Most people are wonderful and will ask thoughtful questions that show they were really engaged with your presentation. 
* For the difficult questions
	* Thank them for asking — it disarms the energy immediately
	* Gracefully pivot to a related topic
	* It's ok to say that you don't know, but that you will: (A) Take that into consideration, (B) Follow-up at a later date, (C) Think that it's a great question, but outside the scope of your presentation.
	* If they keep asking endless follow-ups
		* Politely answer and then say that you'd like to hear from additional members of the audience.
