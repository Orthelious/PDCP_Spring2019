# [G.2] Network Building

*Why a lecture on network building?*

A few reasons:* My opinion is that the most valuable advice comes from those with directexperience* Good networks are powerful tools* It’s hard to“seek advice,” without advisors* Networking is supes awkward, but a necessary business skillset

Five sections to this lecture:

1. Professional preparation2. Types of networks3. Common opportunities for networking4. Networking tips5. Mock networking event!

## Professional Preperation
Make sure your public persona is locked in and your tools ready:* Make sure your website / resume / portfolio is up to date* Set privacy settings on social media accounts* Create ‘professional’ social media accounts* Materials printed and on-hand* Have your Rolodex at the ready	* (who knows what this is?)

## Types of Networks

**Expansive** — The whole enchilada. This is the umbrella network of everyone youknow.**Nodal** — A set of industry-specific or context-specific contacts**Operational** — People you connect to through your place of employment**Strategic** — People who aren’t necessarily tied to an industry (nodal), but canoffer valuable insight, advice, or strategy from a larger perspective**Personal** — Your friends, family, etc.

## Common Opportunities for Networking
* Cold calls* * Networking events * Professional events (Conferences, seminars)* Social events* Informational interviews

*Cold calls are a terrible idea. Focus on getting an introduction by a third party—i.e. I introduce you to my friend within a company via e-mail.

## Networking Tips
### *In General*

* **INITIATE** — You have to try* **CULTIVATE** — Focus on relationship building* **RECIPROCATE** — Pay it forward. Introduce others. Advocate. Build trustand camaraderie

### *Online*

* Writ wel and fcous on as efw err rs as posable* Write for the audience and for whomever it could be forwarded to* Double-check anything googlable* Remember that nothing completely vanishes thanks to screenshots* Tone—The less human the method, the harder to read emotion

### *In-person*

* Remember Inigo Montoya

### *Utilizing Advocates*

A good advocate can be your most powerful tool* Make sure your advocate is willing* Make sure your advocate is well informed* Only use advocates that know you well	* Or have at least seen a recent resume
