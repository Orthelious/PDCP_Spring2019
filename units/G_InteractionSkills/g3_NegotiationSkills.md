## What is negotiation?
### — A quick definition

*Negotiation is…** A process for settling differences* A method for achieving compromise and agreement* A way to avoid argument and dispute*Negotiation is not…** About winning at all costs

What are some negotiations you have participated in?

### The two factors
Good negotiators are seeking a balance between two factors:

1. Gaining as much value as possible2. But preserving the relationship with the other party

## The Negotiation Matrix

Determining how you will fulfill your wants and needs while considering theirwants and needs will define your negotiation style.This is best illustrated by the Lewicki and Hiam Negotiation Matrix.

## The five steps of negotiation
### 1. Preparation and Planning

*You have to be prepared before you walk into the negotiation:** Gather information and cement your position* Know your WATNA, BATNA and ZOPA

*...my what-now?*

* **W.A.T.N.A**— Worst Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement	* If you can’t come to an agreement, what’s the worst case scenario?* **B.A.T.N.A.**— Best Alternative To a Negotatiated Agreement	* If this doesn’t work out, do you have a backup plan?

* **Z.O.P.A**— Zone Of Potential Agreement

### 2. Setting the StageUnderstand the parameters of the negotiation:

* Who are the parties?
* Who are the negotiators?* Where will this take place?* What is the time limit?* Is there anything that is off-limits?### 3. Clarification
Clarify what you’re negotiating:* What are you negotiating?* What’s the goal(s) of the negotiation?* What’s the priority?* Do you have some common ground?### 4. Bargaining and Problem Solving*Offer! Counter-offer! Propose! Deny! Argue! Haggle! Fight it out!*
### 5. Closure and Implementation
Once you’ve come to an agreement:* Solidify the terms* Make a plan of action

## Tools of Persuation

Negotiators’ tactics and moves to gain advantage often fall underthree general tools of persuasion:1. **Perception and appearance**
	* Using positions of authority to claim a higher ground.  
	* Relying on the other parties' perception to gain a higher ground (Age, gender, size, appearance).2. **Emotion and attitude**
	* Ramping up the other parties emotions using tactics like anger, guilt, condescension, pity and in many cases low-key gaslighting.3. **Logic and reason**
	* My preferred method of negotiation. Creating a sound argument based on a strong, logical framework. 

In short, if the other party resorts to tactics 1 & 2, it's because they don't have a strong 3. 

## Common Pitfalls
Some of the most common negotiation mistakes you can make are:* Not coming prepared* Not considering the other side’s point of view* Being scared to offend the other side* Getting offended* Giving way to emotional pressure* Giving way to perceived authority* Trying to win at all costs* Stonewalling the other party
