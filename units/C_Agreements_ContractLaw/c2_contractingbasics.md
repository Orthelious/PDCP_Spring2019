### How can you access a lawyer?* **Seek recommendations** — Talk to your network (friends, mentors, family, etc.).* **Get a quote** — Most lawyers will give you an upfront estimate of what a service costs. Some may offer to do work Pro Bono (free)* **VLA** — Check local arts councils and artist support organizations for a [Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts](https://www.pittsburghartscouncil.org/vla) program.

## Common contract elements
Contracts can contain what seem like endless amounts of clauses, articles, provisios, etc. Too many to cover in this course. Below are just some of the more common clauses to be aware of: 

**— PARTIES*** Who is this contract between?**— TERM (TIME)*** What is the duration of this contract?* When does it start?* Are there key dates?**— PURPOSE*** You’ll sometimes see this in sections like “Statement of Work,” “Terms of Service,” and “Engagement”* What is this contract for?* What is the scope of the work?

**— PAYMENT AND PRICE*** How much are you getting paid?* How and when will you get paid?**— STATUS*** Are you an employee? A contractor? A purchaser? A seller?**— OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER*** Is IP or property involved?* Are you transferring those rights?* How and under what conditions does that happen?

**— INDEMNITY AND LIABILITY*** What can you be held responsible for?* Are you able to be compensated for losses?**— PENALTY AND DAMAGES*** If you break the rules of the contract, are there consequences?* And are there limits to those consequences?**— ASSIGNMENT*** Can a party assign the rights of this contract to a 3rd party?* Can they do that without your permission?

**— ARBITRATION AND/OR GOVERNING LAW*** How are disagreements settled?* Which body of law will be used to interpret the agreement? (i.e. which US state, country, etc.)**— RENEGOTIATION AND RENEWAL*** Can you change parts of the agreement after you sign it?* If the contract period expires, can you renew it? Is renewal automatic?**— SEVERABILITY AND TERMINATION*** How can you get out of the contract?* What can invalidate the contract?* If the contract is cancelled, what are you still responsible for?

**— SPECIAL PROVISIONS OR “GENERAL”**
* This is the dumping ground where you will find additional clauses and provisions not already covered by “standard” sections of the contract.

## How a contract can end
If things goes *well* and/or the contract is for a s*et period of time:** The contract should end automatically once the duties of both parties have been fulfilled.If things *aren’t going well *and/or the contract is *ongoing*:* **By agreement** – Both parties agree to end the contract early.* **By frustration** – Something happens that prevents the contracts from beingcompleted and is out of both parties’ control.* **For convenience** – A party can quit at any time by notifying the other party.* **Due to breach** – If one party is not following the terms of the contract, the other party may sue for damages and/or to terminate the contract.

## A few parting thoughts
