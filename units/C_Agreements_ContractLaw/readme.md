# UNIT C — Agreements and Contract Law

Summary — One of the major lessons I hope you take away from this course is: never start work without an agreement in place! It is essential to understand how a legal agreement can restrain you, bind you, empower you, and—most importantly of all—protect you. During this unit we will discuss what constitutes a legal agreement, the essential elements of any contract, and how to identify warning signs in tricky, often imperceptible legal language.
