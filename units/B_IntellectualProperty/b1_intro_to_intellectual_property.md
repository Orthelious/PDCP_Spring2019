# [B.1]	Introduction to Intellectual Property 

*In short, Unit B is an introduction to what constitutes intellectual property, what rights you have, and how to use IP laws and regulations to your advantage to protect, create, remix, transform, and share your work.*

1. Defining Intellectual Property
2. The Big Three in IP: Patent, Copyright, Trademark
3. Why it's important to understand IP

## // Defining Intellectual Property
### — What is intellectual property?

*» From Merriam-Webster*
> Intellectual Property : property (such as an idea, invention, or process) thatderives from the work of the mind or intellect; also : an application, right, orregistration relating to this

*» A simple definition:*

* The result (work or invention) of creativity.*» IP also refers to:*

* The rights, priorities and privileges of your work.* The categories of laws and regulations that prevent unauthorized use byothers.

Much like physical property, IP can be created, owned, traded, destroyed, transferred, stolen, borrowed, etc. The key distinction here is that it is property that is generated of the intellect...

...and thus needs it's own set of rules, guidelines, and regulations. IP helps define all of the ideas, processes, and plans closely tied with a piece of property, but that can be separated from the property itself. 

### — The Origin of IP
I'm going to totally pull the laziness card and just play this section of the video essay "Everything is a Remix" by Kirby Ferguson.

## // The Big Three in IP: Patent, Copyright, Trademark
There are a number of smaller, specific categories of IP in US law ([like plant species!](https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/upov_plant_variety_fulltext.html)) For the purposes of this course, we're going to discuss the three major categories of IP:

* **Patents** — Protects specific inventions and related processes.* **Copyrights** — Protects “original works of authorship.”* **Trademark** — Protects names, phrases and symbols used in commerce.

*We will go over each of these in much greater detail in [B.2]*

### — Patents
*» What do they protect?*
* Processes, methods and inventions that are “novel,” “non-obvious,” and“useful.”* A patent cannot protect a idea on its own. The idea must be part ofsomething recognizable and distinct.* Patents can apply to: processes and methods; a manufactured article(object); a new composition (of matter); an asexually and new variety ofplant.

### — Copyrights

*» What do they protect?*
* “Original works of authorship.”* Which include: literary works; musical works, including any accompanyingwords; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimesand choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural works; motionpictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; architectural works;computer programs (sometimes the graphical user interface) and websites.* Ideas and concepts **on their own** do not have copyright   
	*[Why would this be true?]*
	
### — Trademarks

*» What do they protect?*

* Names, phrases, images that represent a product and distinguish it incommerce.* Includes Trade Dress (visual appearance of a product) and Service Marks(Identifies a service as opposed to a product.)* Basically, trademarks protect brands.

## // Why it's important to understand IP

***Your practice will be more successful if you understand:***
* The difference between the IP that you do and do not own.
* How to utilize the IP of others.* How you can protect your work.* How you can defend yourself and your work.
