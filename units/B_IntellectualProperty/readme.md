# UNIT B — Intellectual Property
***Summary*** — As creative practitioners, we all participate in the act of intellectual property creation. Whether that’s for our own personal work, as part of our professional practice, or in service to an employer or client. But what is intellectual property? In this unit we will define the legal definitions of IP, the rights that you have, and IP protections such as patent, copyright, trademark, etc. From there, we will discuss how to share and monetize IP as a method for generating value. We will also explore the ways in which we can change, alter, rip, pirate, destroy, remix and recreate the work of others as a part of our creative process.
