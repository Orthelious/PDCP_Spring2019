Three sections in this lecture: 

1. [Licenses](#lic)
2. [Royalties](#roy)
3. [Elements of an licensing and royalty agreement](#ele)

## <a name="lic">Licenses</a>
### Quick Definition

>**License** — A grant by the holder of a copyright or patent to another of any of the rights embodied in the copyright or patent short of an assignment of all rights. [[Source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/license)

### What is a license?
* Licenses are basically ‘permissions for use.’* Licenses are a **type of agreement** * Based on the concept of **divisibility**.	* The Copyright Act of 1976 allows copyright holders to grant narrowly defined licenses (i.e. permissions) dividing up the rights of their copyrighted works.* Think of this as granting a ‘limited copyright’ to someone else.* Licenses can apply to Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks.

### Rights a license can grant‡* Reproduce the work in copies.* Prepare derivative works based upon the work.* Distribute copies of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership orby rental, lease, or lending.* Perform the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work;a pantomime; or a motion picture or other audiovisual work.* Display the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work; a pantomime; or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work. This right also applies to the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.* Perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission if the work is a sound recording.***‡Look familiar? It's the same as the rights that are conferred by trademarks, copyrights and patents.***


## <a name="roy">Royalties</a>
### Quick Definition:
>**Royalty** — A payment to an author or composer for each copy of a work sold or to an inventor for each item sold under a patent.

##### — What is the difference between a royalty and a license?

* License = The permission
* Royalty = The payment

A license grants permission to use the IP. The royalty is the payment for that use.

##### — A few examples of types of royalty rates:

* **Per Unit**— You receive a percentage of the sale of each unit. 
	
	For example, the percentage a musician receives each time their song plays on spotify.

* **Net Sales** — You receive a percentage of total sales. 
	
	For example, your agent sells hundreds of your prints of all different sizes. Rather than assign a different, unique percentage per artwork, you agree to a 10% take of the final sales total.  

* **Guaranteed Minimum** — Regardless if the merchandise sells or not, you are paid a guaranteed minimum payment. 

	For example, you license a photo to be reproduced on bucket hats with a guaranteed minimum of $100. Then bucket hats go out of fashion and the company can't sell any—you will receive your minimum regardless. 

* *And many many more.*

##### **~A NOTE~**
Please remember that these are *just* starting points. Things get complex when you start examining how licenses and royalties apply across different creative practices. 

*For example:*

## <a name="ele">Elements of a license and royalty agreement</a>

##### — License and royalty agreements acutally protect *both parties*

* The licensor (IP owner) has their copyright protected from misuse and is paid for the use of their IP
* The licensee (Buyer) is protected from claims of improper use by the licensor, as the terms for use are spelled out in the agreement. 

##### — Elements of a licensing and royalty agreement: * **Purpose of license** — Which of your copyright(s) are you granting them? (For example: allowing someone to create derivative works.)
* **Scope and Limitations of Use** — What limits are place on the use? Is it a one-time use for a specific reproduction? Is it a world-wide license? Are there limitations to how many copies or reproductions?* **Term** — Time period of the license. Is it a one-time license? Perpetual?* **Consideration** — Flat fee? Royalty (percentage of sales)? A combination? How will you get paid and how often?* **Exclusivity** — Is this an exclusive or non-exclusive license?* **Attribution and Display** — How will you be credited? How will the work be displayed?* **Termination** (We’ll cover this in the Contracts Unit)* **Indemnification** (We’ll cover this in the Contracts Unit)* **Arbitration** (We’ll cover this in the Contracts Unit)
