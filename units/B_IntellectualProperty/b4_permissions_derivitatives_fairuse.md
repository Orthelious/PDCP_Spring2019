## Transference
*A quick definition:*
>**Transfer** — The act of assigning the rights to a piece of intellectual property belonging to one party, through written instrument, to another party. 

What is transference?
* The act of giving your full IP rights away to another party.	* The rights to Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks can all be transferred to another party.* This should be done via a written, legal agreement.* This is common in Work-For-Hire agreements. When the contract is complete, the IP is transferred over to the principal. * Moral rights (VARA), however, cannot be transferred, *but they may be waived.*


## Derivative Works
*A quick definition:*
>Derivative Work — A derivative work is a new, original product that includes aspects of a preexisting, already copyrighted work. Also known as a "new version," derivative works can include musical arrangements, motion pictures, art reproductions, sound recordings or translations. They can also include dramatizations and fictionalizations, such as a movie based on a play. [[Source]](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-are-derivative-works-under-copyright-law)

##### — What are some examples of derivative works?
* A motion picture based on a play or novel
* A translation of an novel written in English into another language
* A revision of a previously published book
* A sculpture based on a drawing
* A drawing based on a photograph
* A lithograph based on a painting
* A drama about John Doe based on the letters and journal entries of John Doe
* A musical arrangement of a preexisting musical work
* A new version of an existing computer program
* An adaptation of a dramatic work
* A revision of a website

### Compilations
Compilations differ from derivative works. Rather than an entirely new, original product, compilations are often arrangements or coordinations of prior works and their ability to be copywritten *depends...*

*Here's a definition from the US Copyright Office:  
*(Emphasis mine)
>Compilations of data or compilations of preexisting works (also known as “collective works”) may also be copyrightable if the materials are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the **resulting work as a whole constitutes a new work**. 
>
>When the collecting of the preexisting material that makes up the compilation is a purely mechanical task with no element of original selection,coordination, or arrangement, such as a white-pages telephone directory, copyright protection for the compilation is not available.

### Who can create derivative works?
Well, anyone *can* create a derivative work, but whether or not you have a *right* to make that derivative is what is at stake here. 

* Copyright owners have the *exclusive* rights to create derivative works. 
* Permissions can be granted to other parties to make derivative works through—you guessed it—licenses!
* This does not apply to cases of **Fair Use** (discussed later)

### How does copyright law treat derivative works?
Just because you gain permission to create a derivative work, does not mean you automatically gain copyright protection. 

In the case of derivative works:

* If you obtain permission to use copyrighted material from the owner (via a license), this *does not* mean you obtain the copyright to the original IP. 
* Likewise, the original copyright of licensed material *does not* extend to your derivative work. i.e. the licensor cannot claim ownership of the licensee's work. 
* Derivative works can obtain their own copyright for original elements, but they *do not* reset the expiration clock on the *original material's copyright*

## Open Source and Public Licenses
Creating individual licenses for each specific use of your IP can a cumbersome process. This bureaucracy also slows down the creative process significantly as obtaining permissions can be a months-long to years-long process. 

One solution is to use a **public license** — essentially a stamp that declares how your work may be used without needing explicit permission for each use. 

One of the most commonly used is [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). 

*Here some examples of their licenses:*

* **Attribution** — This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

* **Attribution-NoDerivs** — This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.

* **Attribution-NonCommercial** — This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.

### — Open Source Licenses
Free public licenses are especially important for software and technology creation. Because of the complexities of these technologies, sometimes a more robust public license is needed. 

*These are just two of the most common open-source licenses for open source software:* 

* [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) 
* [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A more robust list can be found on [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses/category).

## Fair Use
*A quick definition:*
>**Fair Use** — Fair use is a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances. [[source]](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html)

**An important note: Fair Use is not an *automatic right* to use. It is a *defense* that can be used when accused of infringement.**

*Let's watch a video*

*There's also this terribly hard to watch, but entertaining video:* [A Fair(y) Use Tale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJn_jC4FNDo)

### There four factors of fair use:* The purpose and character of your use.* The nature of the copyrighted work.* The amount and substantiality of the portion taken.* The effect of the use upon the potential market.

Here are a few famous examples of Fair Use cases from [artistrights.info](http://www.artistrights.info/):

* [ROGERS V. KOONS](http://www.artistrights.info/rogers-v-koons/)

* [WOJNAROWICZ V. AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION](http://www.artistrights.info/wojnarowicz-v-american-family-association)
* [CARIOU V. PRINCE](http://www.artistrights.info/cariou-v-prince
)


## THE PUBLIC DOMAIN*A quick definition:*
>**Public Domain** — the realm embracing property rights that belong to the community at large, are unprotected by copyright or patent, and are subject to appropriation by anyone. [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/public%20domain?utm_campaign=sd&utm_medium=serp&utm_source=jsonld)### What does it mean when IP enters the Public Domain?* Intellectual property that belongs to and is available to, the public as awhole.* IP enters the public domain when protection terms have expired or the rights have been waived.* You can use work in the Public Domain without any licenses or prior permission, but there is a [creative commons license avaialable.](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/)* You cannot claim ownership of items in the public domain! But elements of your derivatives *may* fall under copyright protection.
