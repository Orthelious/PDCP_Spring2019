# [B.2] IP Protections and Artists Rights

*Four sections to this topic*

1. Patents
2. Trademarks
3. Copyrights
4. The Visual Artists Rights Act

In B.1 we covered the high level basics of the three primary types of IP protections: Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights. In this lecture we will cover the process of how to obtain each of these protections and delve into what specifically each IP type protects. 

*» Relevant IP-related items we will cover in future units include:*

* How to take legal action.* Takedown notices and cease-and-desist letters.* Specific IP laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act* Pricing and structures for licenses * Contract elements

Additionally, this unit will touch on the visual artist specific Visual Artist Rights Act. 

*» A few notes*

* IP protections ≠ Prerequisites to creation* Correct answers ≠ Right answers* This lecture specifically covers United States law. * I am not a lawyer. Take what I say with a grain of salt. I’m more like a... swimming pool lifeguard.

### — What is a Patent?
* A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor,issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.* US patents only apply within the United States and US territories.* Patents grant the right to exclude others from making, using, offering forsale, or selling” the invention in the United States or “importing” theinvention into the United States.	* A Patent is not a right to **make**, but a right to **exclude**.
### — What patents protect 

* Processes, methods and inventions that are “novel,” “non-obvious,” and“useful.”* A patent cannot protect a idea on its own. The idea must be part ofsomething recognizable and distinct.* Patents can apply to: processes and methods; a manufactured article(object); a new composition (of matter); an asexually and new variety ofplant.

### — Types of Patents
1. **Utility Patents** — invention or discovery of any new and usefulprocess, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, orany new and useful improvement thereof.2. **Design Patents** — Granted to anyone who invents a new, original, andornamental design for an article of manufacture3. **Plant patents** — Granted to anyone who invents or discovers andasexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant.

### — Time-restrictions for Patents  

* The term of a patent is 20 years.* Under certain circumstances this can be extended.

### — The Patent Process

1. Determine if your invention is patentable (Novel, Non-Obvious and Useful).2. Conduct a search for prior patents or public disclosures (i.e. Has it alreadybeen patented by someone else?)3. Determine the type of patent you need (Utility, Design, or Plant)4. File an application with the US Patent and Trademark Office and pay thefee. (A patent lawyer is strongly encouraged)5. Work with an examiner, who will review patent application. (USPTO)6. If approved, maintain your patent (There are maintenance fees)

>**Trademark** — Protects names, phrases and symbols used in commerce.

### — Key Government Agency
[United States Patent and Trademark Office
](https://www.uspto.gov/)

### — What is a trademark (or service mark)?* A trademark is generally a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or acombination thereof, that identifies and distinguishes the source of thegoods of one party from those of others.* A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies anddistinguishes the source of a service rather than goods.

### — What Trademarks Protect
* Names, phrases, images that represent a product and distinguish it incommerce.* Basically, trademarks protect brand.

### — The Trademark process* Similar to the Patent Process, you must register trademarks through the USPatent and Trademark Office.* The most important part of applying for a Trademark is the considerationstep. Consideration refers to determining if the mark:
	* Is a “strong” or “weak” mark	* Is likely to be confused with other marks	* Similarity to other marks	* and many more!

>**Copyrights** — Protects “original works of authorship.”

### — Key Government Agency
[U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/)

### — What does a copyright protect?* “Original works of authorship.”* Which include: literary works; musical works, including any accompanyingwords; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimesand choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural works; motionpictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; architectural works;computer programs (sometimes the graphical user interface) and websites.* Ideas and concepts on their own do not have copyright protection.

### — What are the rights of a copyright owner?* Reproduce the work in copies.* Prepare derivative works based upon the work.* Distribute copies of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership orby rental, lease, or lending.* Perform the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work;a pantomime; or a motion picture or other audiovisual work.* Display the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work; apantomime; or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work. This right also applies to theindividual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.* Perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission if the work is asound recording.

### — What is not covered by a copyright?* Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, ordiscoveries* Works that are not fixed in a tangible form (such as a choreographic workthat has not been notated or recorded or an improvisational speech thathas not been written down)* Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans* Familiar symbols or designs* Mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring* Mere listings of ingredients or contents

### — Who can claim copyright?* The author(s) of the work.* For joint authors:	* If works are combined into a single work, joint authors share **equalownership**.	* If authors contribute to a collective work, each author retains the rightto **their individual contribution**. * [Works-for-hire ](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf) (i.e. parties that pay for the work to be made)

	*Two types of work-for-hire to be aware of:*
	* A work prepared by an employee within the scope of [their] employment 
	* A work specially ordered or commissioned for use  

### — How do I create a copyright for my work?* Surprise! Copyright exists automatically in an original, finished work.* The work must be in a **fixed, tangible medium**.*Then why would copyright registration exist?** Copyright registration **enhances** your already existing rights.

**» Reasons to register:**

* To bring a copyright infringement case to court, your work must beregistered.* To sue for statutory damages ($$$), your work must be registered.* You can only sue for the attorney’s fees and costs of litigation if your work isregistered.

**» How to register:*** Complete a filing form with the US Copyright Office.* Give them a non-refundable filing fee.* Send in copies of the work (i.e. samples, photos, etc.)

### — Term of a Copyright* For an individual: Life of the author + 70 years* For works-for-hire: 95 years from publication or 120 yearsfrom creations. Whichever is shorter.* Copyrights, like physical property, and can be inherited or transferred, but thisdoesn’t restart the clock on the term of the copyright.

## // The Visual Artists Rights Act
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/b2_tiltedarc.jpg)  
[VARA was enacted in the wake of the "Tilted Arc" controversy of 1990.](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-why-the-visual-artists-rights-act-is-failing-to-protect-street-art-and-murals) 

### — What is VARA?* A 1990 Act of Congress granting additional protections specifically forcategories of visual art.* Before this act, artists in the United States had virtually no power to protecttheir work from mutilation, misattribution, or destruction.* VARA assigns “Moral Rights” in addition to Copyrights.

### — VARA Moral Rights:* **Disclosure or divulgation**, which allows the artist to determine when awork is complete and may be displayed.* **Paternity or attribution**, which allows an artist to protect the identificationof their name with their own work, and to disclaim it when applied toanother’s.* **The right of withdrawal**, which permits the artist to modify or withdraw awork following publication.* **Integrity**, which allows the artist to prevent their work from being displayedin an altered, distorted, or mutilated form.

### — What kind of art does VARA cover?* Very limited categories of fine art.* VARA covers: Paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, still photographs produced for exhibition.* Within this group, only single copies or signed and numbered limited editions of 200 or less areactually protected.
### — How long does VARA last?* The lifetime of the author.* For multiple authors, on the the death of the last author.### — Fun loophole!* Under VARA (unlike copyright infringement), an artist has a cause of action in a federal courteven if their artwork is not registered with the Copyright Office.
